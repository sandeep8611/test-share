I hope you’re both doing well.

As you may remember, I worked closely with you to enable ROD for teams outside the ICG sector, and I’m happy to share that more teams in our CISC sector are now adopting it. This is an amazing tool, and I’d love to see even more teams leveraging it for automating their releases.

I was wondering if there are any metrics available that I could access to gain insights into how many teams in our sector are adopting ROD. Having this data would help me better understand our impact and drive further adoption.

Let me know if this is possible. I’d really appreciate any guidance you can provide.

Thanks,
