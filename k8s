As part of our commitment to engineering excellence, we ensure that our codebase is not only functionally correct but also adheres to high standards of readability, consistency, and maintainability. To achieve this, we have incorporated the following tools into our automated testing pipeline:
Black
Purpose: Code Formatter

Lint (Linters)
Purpose: Code Quality Checker

Flake8
Purpose: Linter for Code Style and Quality

isort
Purpose: Imports Sorting


Lint/Linters: Detects potential errors, bugs, and style violations.
Flake8: A specific linter that checks for coding style (PEP 8), errors, and complexity.
isort: Sorts imports in Python code in a consistent manner.

These tools are commonly used together to ensure that code is clean, formatted, and error-free.
