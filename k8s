Test Repository Access:

Manual Testing:
Attempt to manually access various repositories through the proxy using tools like curl or wget. This helps verify that the proxy is correctly routing requests.
Example command:
sh
Copy code
curl -I -x http://your-proxy:port https://repository.url/path/to/resource
Pipeline Job:
Create a simple pipeline job that attempts to download artifacts from multiple repositories. Check if the job succeeds for all repositories.
Example pipeline script (Jenkinsfile for Jenkins):
groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test Repository Access') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def repositories = [
                        'https://repo1.url/path/to/artifact',
                        'https://repo2.url/path/to/artifact',
                        // Add more repositories as needed
                    ]
                    repositories.each { repo ->
                        sh "curl -I -x http://your-proxy:port ${repo}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Automated Tests:

Implement automated tests in your pipeline that check access to various repositories and validate the retrieved content.
Use tools like pytest or Jest to write test cases that attempt to fetch resources from different repositories and verify the response.
