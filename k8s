Team,

Renovate allows us to automatically generate PRs whenever a newer base image or package version is available.

I am starting the onboarding process for our aquased project, beginning with aquased-api. Once onboarding is complete, Renovate will generate PRs to upgrade both the base image and packages automatically.

While this automation helps keep our dependencies up to date, it may also introduce issues. We need to be mindful when merging these PRs. A simple rule of thumb I’m following:

Minor version upgrades – Generally safe to merge.
Major version upgrades – Require testing before merging.
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!
