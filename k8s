As the Technical Lead for multiple container security work streams at JP, I am responsible for the overall architecture, scalability, security, and availability of our platform, which supports the entire bank’s container security infrastructure. My core responsibilities include:
	1	Technical Leadership and Architecture Design: I oversee the technical design and architecture of our platform, ensuring it is scalable and reliable for the bank’s global operations. For instance, our Vulnerability Scanning as a Service (VSaaS) handles 65K scan requests per month, and our 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (XX) ingests over 100 images daily from external registries. These systems must scale efficiently and meet the needs of teams across all sectors of the bank.
	2	Ensuring Availability and Resiliency: I am responsible for ensuring that our platform remains highly available and resilient. This involves implementing strategies for 24/7 availability, monitoring, alerting, as well as performing regular health checks and proactive maintenance to prevent downtime or service disruptions. I lead initiatives to enhance system performance and ensure a smooth, uninterrupted service for all users.
	3	Security and Compliance: Security is the forefront of my role. I lead efforts to ensure that all components of our platform are secure by following rigorous security practices, including threat modeling, ISRP, and continuous vulnerability assessments. These efforts ensure that the platform complies with JP’s security standards and industry regulations, maintaining a secure environment for container management.
	4	Support and Operational Leadership:
            I lead the support and operational model for all platforms and services under my purview. This includes defining and overseeing operational processes to ensure smooth day-to-day functioning, addressing any incidents swiftly, and ensuring continuous service delivery. I provide both proactive and reactive support to maintain the health and reliability of the platform.
	6	People Management: I manage a team of four engineers and one contractor, providing leadership, mentorship, and guidance. I ensure alignment with strategic objectives and focus on the professional development of my team members, encouraging growth in both their technical and career acumen. As their manager, I am also responsible for administrative tasks such as conducting annual performance reviews, overseeing career development plans, and managing day-to-day personnel matters, ensuring a balanced and productive work environment.
Overall, I lead the technical direction and strategy for our platform while ensuring operational excellence, security, and scalability across all of JP’s container security services.
