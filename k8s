Due to a recently identified vulnerability, Postman has been disabled at Citi. As an alternative, you can now use SoapUI. It's available for download via DevHub or can be installed manually. Please transition to SoapUI for your API testing needs.

To ensure the ingestion process is not delayed due to the unavailability of key personnel like App Owners or ISOs, we need to implement a delegation approval process. This involves integrating with JP API to fetch delegation/manager details and updating the pipeline approval workflow to allow designated managers or support managers to approve ingestions. This feature aims to streamline the approval process, reduce delays, and improve the overall efficiency of the ingestion pipeline.

Delegation Feature:

Introduce a feature that allows delegation of approval to a designated manager or support manager when the App Owner or ISO is unavailable.
Ensure that the delegation process is secure and clearly documented in the pipeline.
Integration with JP API:

Check if the JP API provides information on delegation, managers, or support managers.
Integrate with JP API to fetch the necessary delegation/manager/support manager details.
Approval Workflow:

Update the approval workflow to include the ability for delegated personnel to approve image ingestions.
Ensure that the approval records clearly indicate when a delegation has been used.
Notification and Alerts:

Implement notification mechanisms to inform the delegates when they need to approve an ingestion request.
Provide alerts to the App Owner or ISO when a delegation is triggered.
User Interface Updates:

Update the user interface to allow users to set and view delegation details.
Ensure that users can easily identify who the current approvers and delegates are.
Documentation and User Guidance:

Provide clear documentation on how to set up and use the delegation feature.
Include guidelines on how to manage delegation settings and what to do if an approver is unavailable.
