Goal Title:
Enhance Financial Performance by Transitioning from Twistlock to Aqua for Container Scanning

Goal Description:
To improve financial performance, we are transitioning from Twistlock to Aqua for all our services and products by Q2. This transition includes ensuring full support within the VSaaS (Vulnerability Scanning as a Service) container scanning API for Aqua, replacing Grafeas with Aqua, and updating our pipelines to support Aqua. Achieving these milestones will result in significant financial savings and reduced support overhead.

Objectives:

Full Integration of Aqua in VSaaS:
Provide full support for Aqua within the VSaaS container scanning API for backend scanning.
Replacement of Grafeas with Aqua:
Develop and implement a fully functional Grafeas-replacement library to support Aqua, removing all dependencies on Grafeas.
Populate new data in Aqua and migrate existing data from Grafeas to Aqua, ensuring all new data is pulled and persisted in Aqua.
This replacement will significantly reduce financial costs and the support required for maintaining an extra product.
Pipeline Transition:
Ensure full support for external ingestion, UBI, and Middleware pipelines to use Aqua instead of Twistlock for backend scanning.
RHEL7 to RHEL8/9 Transition:
Enhance the UBI pipeline to support RHEL 8 and 9 using Aqua for backend scanning by the end of June, in light of the discontinuation of RHEL7 support by the Linux team.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Successful Integration:
Complete integration of Aqua into the VSaaS container scanning API, eliminating all dependencies on Twistlock and Grafeas.
Data Migration and Accuracy:
Successful migration of all data from Grafeas to Aqua with no data loss.
Ensure all new data is accurately pulled and persisted in Aqua.
Pipeline Support:
Full operational support for external ingestion, UBI, and Middleware pipelines using Aqua by the end of Q2.
Complete transition of UBI pipeline to support RHEL 8 and 9 using Aqua by the end of June.
Financial Savings:
Achieve projected savings of $1MM over 3 years in licensing costs by transitioning from Twistlock to Aqua.
Expected Outcomes:

Enhanced efficiency and reduced delays in the CI/CD pipeline.
Improved developer productivity and satisfaction by reducing build times.
Streamlined and efficient vulnerability scanning process.
Significant financial savings and reduced support overhead.
Timeline:

Complete all transitions and integrations by the end of Q2.
Transition UBI pipeline to support RHEL 8 and 9 by the end of June.
