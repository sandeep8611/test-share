New Features

VSaaS now supports multi-arch images for scanning.	The 3rd-party-operator pipeline can now scan images with multi-arch support, improving compatibility.
VSaaS now supports an additional repository, docker-gas-*, for image scanning.	Users can now scan images from docker-gas-* repositories, expanding supported registries.
Security and Improvements
Security/Improvement	Benefit
Improved error message for unsupported registries, including DEV Artifactory (xoc.artifactrepo-dev.net).	Users now receive a clear error message: "Invalid input: Scan of images in registry xxxx.artifactrepo-dev.net is not supported with VSaaS", improving user experience.
Updates to the scan request throttle whitelist.	More teams, including the OpenShift Platform team, can now submit scan requests without hitting the throttle limit.
Improved handling of rescan requests for images that have not been previously scanned.	Instead of an error, users now receive a clear message explaining that rescans for unscanned images are not supported and should request a fresh scan instead.
Base image upgrade.	The base image used by VSaaS has been updated to the latest version, ensuring improved security and performance.
Upgraded Python-Json-Logger and Tabulate libraries.	Addressed and fixed high vulnerabilities in the libraries, enhancing overall security and stability of the application.
