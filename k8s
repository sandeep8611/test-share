The teams are already starting migration along with new teams into 3PIIP. Just to reiterate, our documentation and support model needs to be executed as we planned so that teams can onboard as self-service. Without going to specific task details, just to reiterate our milestone here while I am away.

Aqua Migration- Riaz is looking into it. Haroon will be back on Tuesday to support the migration, if/when needed.
Middleware Pipeline - I have asked for the detailed steps what is remaining for Migration to RHEL 8 and Aqua. Haroon can you please follow-up and remind, if needed, that this is critical path task and will be blocker when Twistlock is shutdown by end of next month.
New teams onboarding/Migration- Crowdstrike Daemon Set Image team will look into our doc to onboard. Mike will work with his vendor to get Qualys image onboard into 3PIIP.

Please check with Noor in case you have any question or blocker about anything.
