Subject: Urgent: Twistlock Certificate Issue Affecting VSaaS Connection

Hi [Team Lead's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I encountered with the Twistlock console today.

Summary of the Issue:

The Twistlock console is currently down.
Our VSaaS API is unable to connect to Twistlock using the certificate.
After troubleshooting, I discovered that the Twistlock certificate expired today, which matches the timing of the VSaaS failover issue.
Actions Taken:

I spoke with Aamir, who confirmed the certificate expiration. He has received a new certificate for the Twistlock console.
I have uploaded the new certificate to Vault Dev and tested it in our Dev environment. Unfortunately, the VSaaS app is still failing to connect using the new certificate.
Next Steps:

I have requested Aamir to collaborate with Noor on Monday to resolve the certificate issue in the Dev environment.
Once verified in Dev, Aamir will upload the new certificates to Vault PROD, allowing us to restore VSaaS production.
Impact and Temporary Measures:

I tested our CI build, which runs the VSaaS scan through LSE. The CI build is failing fast, so it appears users' CI builds will fail fast with the VSaaS scan but should not impact their overall build time or cause other issues.
I have attached an example of the CI build I ran today for your reference.
Availability:

I will be out of office on Monday. However, please feel free to call me if needed, and I will come online to assist.
Please let me know if you have any questions or require further assistance.

Best regards,
