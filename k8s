The "invalid registry" error occurs because in VSaaS, we only scan images from a specific list of approved registries. If a scan request is made for an image from an unrecognized or unsupported registry, we don’t proceed with the scan. This registry isn’t on our current list, so no scan was attempted.

To investigate further, I’ll check manually to see if the VSaaS FID has access to this registry. However, I’m unsure if supporting this registry is in scope, so I would appreciate guidance on whether we should consider adding it to the approved list.
