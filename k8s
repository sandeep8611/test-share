Strengthen container security across JPMC by providing automated, consistent, and developer-friendly tooling that improves Dockerfiles, base-image hygiene, and vulnerability remediation at scale.
1. Developer-Facing Dockerfile Improvement Tooling
Goal: Ensure teams build secure, compliant, and up-to-date container images from the start.
Scope for 2026:
Introduce a Dockerfile linting/enhancement tool that:
Accepts a Dockerfile as input and returns an improved, security-aligned version.
Enforces JPMC policies (approved base images, supported OS versions, minimal packages, best practices).
Provides contextual guidance (why a change is required and risks avoided).
Options under evaluation:
Internal linting engine purpose-built for JPMC rules.
Integration with internal Gen-AI tooling to generate improved Dockerfiles based on a standard prompt template and JPMC rulesets.
Expected Outcome: Reduced insecure builds, higher adoption of approved base images, and improved consistency across teams.
2. Integration With Existing Container Scanning APIs
Goal: Provide developers with real-time, actionable feedback.
Scope for 2026:
Enable the new improvement tool to call the existing container scanning API.
Present combined feedback:
Security scan results.
Recommended remediations generated by the linting/AI tool.
Provide a single “actionable report” that developers can consume directly in their CI pipeline.
Expected Outcome: Developers receive one unified set of security actions instead of fragmented outputs from multiple systems.
3. Automated Lifecycle & Hygiene Recommendations
Goal: Drive better container hygiene through lifecycle-based automation.
Scope for 2026:
Provide automated, proactive recommendations such as:
“Base image is older than 9 months—upgrade required.”
“Rebuild recommended every 3 months for vulnerability posture.”
“Critical libraries require patching.”
Integrate these nudges into:
CI logs
Developer portals
PR comments (optional future enhancement)
Expected Outcome: Prevent drift, reduce inherited vulnerabilities, and ensure teams remain on supported, secure baselines.
4. Developer Enablement & Adoption Plan
Scope for 2026:
Publish clear guidelines and best practices for Dockerfile security.
Offer workshops/documentation showing how to use the new tooling.
Drive adoption by integrating with existing development workflows (CI/CD, internal IDE plugins, developer portal).
Summary (Use for slide or executive overview)
Deliver a unified Container Security Improvement Framework that enables developers to automatically enhance Dockerfiles, leverage AI-driven recommendations, receive consolidated scan results, and maintain secure, compliant container baselines throughout their lifecycle.
