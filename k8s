Hi Amin,

Thank you for the detailed discussion today and for highlighting your concerns. I have summarized our discussion below:

1. **Support for Tar Format**:
   The Third-Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP) currently supports only images imported from container registries, not in tar or other formats.

2. **Customization of Third-Party Images**:
   As you pointed out, users may want to perform customizations on top of third-party images. This use case is similar to users customizing any approved base image (e.g., a middleware image). Once the image is imported, users do not need to use the 3PIIP for further customization. The customization process for third-party base images must be the same as for any other approved internal base image. Different rules apply when we scan internal images, and the process of promoting these internal images must be managed separately and is not within the scope of the 3PIIP.

I've also included a diagram below to illustrate this workflow.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
