Enhance Container Image Security and Streamline Scanning (Q2)

Objective: Migrate the External Container Image Ingestion pipeline, UBI pipeline, and Middleware pipeline to leverage Aqua's image scanning capabilities by Q2.
Benefits:
Improved Security: Aqua's scanning will strengthen the security posture of our container images by identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential threats.
Streamlined Scanning: Utilizing a single scanning solution across these pipelines will simplify the process and improve efficiency.
Smoother Migration: A well-planned migration ensures minimal disruption and allows teams to effectively utilize Aqua's functionalities.
