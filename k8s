Through participation in the advanced engineering program, I aim to enhance several key areas of my professional development, enabling me to grow as a technical leader at JP:
	1	Developing a Commercial and Enterprise Mindset: I am eager to refine and expand my engineering mindset, particularly in the context of large-scale enterprise systems. Understanding how to balance technical excellence with business objectives will allow me to make more strategic decisions and deliver impactful solutions across the Citi.
	2	Enhancing Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: I look forward to sharpening my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. The program will provide me with the opportunity to approach complex engineering challenges from fresh perspectives, equipping me with tools and methodologies to solve problems more effectively.
	3	Communicating with Influence and Impact: One of my key goals is to improve my ability to communicate technical concepts with influence and clarity, both within my team and across the broader organisation. This will help me ensure that my technical insights are well understood and can drive decision-making at higher levels.
	4	Building Technical Acumen and Expanding Networks: The program presents an excellent opportunity to deepen my technical expertise within JP’s ecosystem while also networking with professionals from outside CISO. I hope to establish strategic relationships, exchange ideas with other leaders, and broaden my perspective on emerging technologies and best practices within JP.
	5	Enhancing Leadership Foundations: As I continue to lead my team and multiple work streams, I see the program as a way to enhance my leadership foundations. I am particularly focused on improving my ability to inspire, mentor, and guide my team while driving successful project outcomes at scale.
