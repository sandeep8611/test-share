I’ve drafted the roadmap and organized it into two tables here: [Confluence link].
The first table includes the items I believe are essential and must be part of the roadmap regardless of assumptions—these are the “can’t miss” items.
The second table includes additional items that may be lower priority, may not fit depending on bandwidth, or may need your input to determine whether they should move into the first table.
When you have a chance, I’d appreciate your feedback on whether the categorization makes sense and if any items should be moved between tables. We can also go through it in more detail during our 1:1 on Monday.
