Hello! For managing and deploying database schema changes, I noticed that the EE team is currently working on adding support for this in Harness. This might be relevant to what you're looking for. You might find more details in this Jira ticket [if you have a specific Jira ticket link, include it here]. If youâ€™re specifically interested in tools similar to Redgate for version control, Harness might soon have built-in capabilities that address this need.
