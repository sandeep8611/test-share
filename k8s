Feedback from the LightSpeed Enterprise (LSE) team highlighted that the VSaaS scan is one of the longest-running steps in the container image build process, causing significant delays. The scan, which runs after the container image build and is almost always the last step, takes over 3 minutes on average. This effectively doubles the build time for performance-sensitive users, making the delay unsustainable and adversely affecting overall productivity.

In response, I have enhanced financial performance by optimizing the VSaaS container scanning process within the LSE pipeline, resulting in a significant reduction in scan times and improved developer productivity.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Reduce Scan Time: Achieve the 99th percentile of scans completing in less than 120 seconds, with the median scan time under 60 seconds.
Improve Developer Productivity: Minimize build times to align with overall build duration targets, thereby reducing the impact on developer productivity.
Outcomes:

Enhanced efficiency and reduced delays in the CI/CD pipeline.
Improved developer productivity and satisfaction by significantly reducing build times.
Streamlined and efficient vulnerability scanning process, contributing to overall financial performance.
