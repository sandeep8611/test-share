## Leadership Review - "How" We Deliver Results

**Demonstrating Ownership, Pride, and Teamwork**

This past year, I've embraced the core leadership principles of ownership, pride, and teamwork to navigate a complex and critical project: the migration of our container security services from Twistlock to Aqua. 

**Taking Ownership:**

* **Expanded Scope:** Leading the VSaaS team last year and successfully transitioning the project to production laid the groundwork. This year, I proactively took ownership of additional critical workstreams – external ingestion pipeline, UBI pipeline, and middleware pipelines – to ensure seamless integration with Aqua.

**Delivering with Pride:**

* **Meeting Tight Deadlines:** We faced a critical deadline to avoid incurring significant licensing costs for both vendors. I led with clear vision, focusing on challenges and solutions rather than dwelling on problems. This fostered a positive, results-oriented environment.
* **Production-Ready Services:** My leadership ensured clear direction, readily available support, and a focus on customer needs. The VSaaS project is already in UAT with Aqua integration. The Grafeas replacement is in progress, and pipelines are being migrated. The critical external ingestion pipeline is actively being productionalized, addressing both technical and human/process challenges.

**Succeeding Together:**

* **Building a High-Performing Team:** Weekly meetings facilitate open communication, address development plans, and cultivate psychological safety. I actively encourage feedback, recognize achievements, and celebrate team victories. Onboarding new team members like Rimas and fostering a continuous learning culture further strengthens our collective success.
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration:**  Building rapport beyond our team, I fostered strong relationships with LightSpeed, Andromeda, and Kibana teams. This facilitated VSaaS integration, platform enhancements, and scalability support, leading to positive feedback and successful project outcomes.

**Leading by Example**

My leadership style prioritizes clear communication, a stress-free environment, and collaborative problem-solving. I empower my team with clear direction, encourage ownership, and celebrate their achievements. By actively managing both permanent and contract staff, I've fostered a strong team spirit and built trust  within the wider container security community.

**Looking Ahead**

Moving forward, I'm committed to continuously improving our processes, maintaining a positive work environment, and collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams.  I am confident that by upholding these leadership principles, my team will continue to deliver exceptional results.
