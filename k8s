I wanted to share a few updates with you:

CrowdStrike Image Onboarding:
I had a productive meeting with a team looking to import the CrowdStrike image using the 3rd party pipeline. They have a good understanding of the requirements and will follow our documentation to proceed with the onboarding.
Qualys Image Import:
Martin's team is currently importing the Qualys image using the old process and receiving it in TAR format. I informed him that the 3rd party pipeline accepts images from a container registry. He will coordinate with the vendor to transition to the 3rd party pipeline, as we no longer support the TAR format.
Aqua Migration:
Romeo is overseeing the Aqua migration for the 3rd party pipeline.
I have asked Haroon to follow up daily with the Middle team to ensure their Aqua migration progresses smoothly. New teams are onboarding while old teams are migrating to the 3rd party pipeline.
SO Approval Process:
There is a team still seeking approval confirmation involving SOs, which is blocking their progress. I clarified in the chat that SO approval in image ingestion was also required in the old process and that we've automated this in our pipeline to address some gaps. However, they still seem to need an approval document. Since I will be out next week, I wanted to bring this to your attention in case they escalate the issue to you.
VSaaS Migration:
The VSaaS migration is progressing well. We successfully migrated another CSI to Aqua on Friday, and the builds are being successfully scanned with VSaaS and Aqua.
