Thank you for your response and for offering alternative cohort options. Unfortunately, due to my childcare responsibilities, switching to the APAC or NAM cohort would not be feasible for me.

It would be best for me to continue with the same cohort, as I can better manage my childcare commitments. While I understand the importance of fully engaging with the module, I will unfortunately have to miss the session on February 5 due to my pre-scheduled Project Vendor meeting.

Please let me know if this works, and I appreciate your understanding and support.
