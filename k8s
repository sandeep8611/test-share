Noor has impressive team skills and is always ready to help both within and across teams, particularly when it contributes to the Aqua migration. During the first half of the year, he worked closely with Chris to modernize our gr-client and other script projects. This collaboration resulted in well-developed code and faster delivery.


Nodir possesses excellent teamwork skills, collaborating effectively within both the VSaaS and Aqua teams, and is always ready to help. He has demonstrated strong technical skills, quickly learning the existing work and delivering it efficiently and professionally. Nodir is continuously improving his capabilities.

Moving forward, Nodir should focus on extending his technical skills into more technical leadership by owning milestones and making decisions independently. He is progressing well and is expected to enhance his area of ownership in the second half of the year.
