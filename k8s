In my role at JP, I lead the Container Security Team as both the Technical and Product Lead. My responsibilities include owning and managing multiple work streams, delivering critical container security services that support the organisation’s containerised infrastructure. Key delierables my role include:
	1	Vulnerability Scanning as a Service (VSaaS): I lead the design, implementation, and management of VSaaS, a state-of-the-art vulnerability scanning solution for container images. This service allows developers across JP to request vulnerabilities scans of their container images and receive actionable, easy-to-understand reports. The solution is developer-friendly, scalable, and integrated with strategic tools such as LightSpeed, Jenkins Enterprise and other firms CI/CD offerings. VSaaS currently handles around 65K scans per month.
	2	3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (XX): I am responsible for the ownership of the 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline, a service that allows our development teams securely ingests container images from external registries. Its self-service model….. More than 50 teams within JP are ingesting at anytime bringing their external container images securely and consistently.
	3	UBI RHEL Base Images: I lead the efforts in the ingestion and management of UBI RHEL base images, which form the backbone of many container images used within JP. My platform ensures that these foundational images are up-to-date, secure, and available for developers and MM teams to build upon.
	4	Partnership with MM Team: I partnered and collaborate extensively with the MM Team to produce secure, approved base images. These images are widely used across JP, helping developers maintain a high standard of security in their containerised applications.
Overall, my role focuses on delivering secure, scalable solutions that enhance JP’s container security landscape, while also driving collaboration across multiple teams and ensuring alignment with strategic goals.


I am applying for entering advanced engineering program. This is program overview. a futural This solective arogram amnamore anainaore to hone and analy their technical chille ae woll ac arom thai
E3 creates the opportunity for talented engineers at JP to step up as technical leaders of the future! This selective program empowers engineers to hone and apply their technical skills, as well as grow their professional network through collaborative working. By completing this exciting E3 program you will develop your engineering mindset, gain new technical knowledge, and develop high performance behavioral skills that unlock your potential as a future change maker! I want to answered few questions to make my application successful. 
First question is "Describe your Role". My role in JP is leading container security team. I am currently owned and managed multiple work stream as Technical and Product Lead. Few products which are included: VSaaS - Vulnerability Scanning as a Service. VSaaS  provides vulnerability scanning for containers. It is a developer friendly, security solution to allow our developers to request vulnerability scanning of their container images and provides easy to understand, actionable vulnerability reports to make better choices about the attack surface of their container images. VSaaS is a state-of-the-art container image scanning service for JP developers and other internal customers in a secure, resilient, and scalable way. It is already integrated with some strategic tooling like LightSpeed, Jenkins Enterprise etc. As of August, VSaaS executes 65K scans / month and is on target to exceed 80K / month by Dec. see http://jp/vsaas . 
I am also owning 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline which is a service that enables ingestion of container images from external registries in a secure and repeatable fashion. As of today, more than 50 teams in JP are extensively using this strategic service to ingest image in JP securely. 
I am also responsible for leading the ingesting UBI RHEL latest base images in JP. These images are the backbone of all the container images built on top of the images. 
Lastly, I am extersively partnered with Middleware Team on producing approved secure base images in JP. Our service pipeline produce these approved base images which are extensively used by our developers in JP.


"How do you currently contribute to the Engineering Culture across the organisation?" 
As part of my continuous delivery of the products I am delivering, I am not only deliver with high quality but these products are now becoming a standard for our teams in CISO to follow. The project VSaaS is in the maturity level 3 of engineering excellence which is the top level project. The frameworks I designed and developed has been used in various other projects in CISO. I was designing from scratch as development micro service. This was the first project in our CISO org that integrate and leverage all the new strategic tooling in JP including LSE, Openshift Andro, Observability/telemetry Kibana/Splunk, Thread modelling, ISRP level etc. In short, this project is now becoming as standard for engineering excellence in CISO. 
As part of my continuous contribution to engineering community, I published regular videos, articles for our engineering community. As part of my continuous effort, my video on techfest titled "How to create, develop, build, deploy, and run apps in Citi" is in the top 10 watched videos in JP. In addition, I have published numerous articles and demos on best practices across various topics which includes devops, container security (jp/slim-container), software testing (jp/software-testing) etc.
I am also mentoring lots of engineers from graduates to VP levels both from my teams and the outside teams.


* How do you see that contribution changing as a result of your E3 graduation?


"Non-engineers can also benefit from version control. I've used Git when working on Excel templates. No need to have 10+ files named
"version 1 as of xxxxxx", "version 2 as of..." when you can leave detailed comments about why each version changed, with Git automatically dating them for you.
Other reasons to use version control even when you're the only person working on a script:
1. Ever work on something, break it, and have no idea how to fix it again? Use git reset to roll back to the last time it worked correctly
2. Are you the kind of person who comments out old code but leaves it in "just in case"? with version control you can just delete it and keep your code clean. the "just in case" code will be saved in the version history.
3. If you're in the middle of a messy refactor, but need to make a small change to the working script? 'git stash' to save your mess,
'git checkout main' to hop back to working code, push the hotfix, then 'git checkout [original branch]' and 'git stash pop' to restore the mess so you can keep working on it. the cherry on top is using 'git merge main' to easily include the hotfix in the mess - if you're moving between SCRIPT ORIGINALps1 and SCRIPT WIP.ps1 then you have to perform copy/paste surgery to get the same results
4. If you work with non-engineers who don't know how to use git/don't have access you can use git hooks to do things like
"automatically save your script to a shared network drive whenever you merge changes to main branch".
5. For personal projects outside of the JP VDI environment, having a Github repo means you can work on your code on any computer. No need to carry around a flash drive.
6. It's nice to see the squares light up on GitHub when you make commits." - This is from Engineering Excellence team chat. I was thinking to reply to this saying that I have written an introductory article for Git §
