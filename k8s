 also attempted to reschedule my MRI appointment on February 3, but NHS is fully booked, and it must be completed this month due to my tumor. That said, I will attend the rest of the sessions.

Just to clarify, even if I were to switch cohorts, I would still be unavailable on February 5, as I will be traveling for my pre-scheduled Project Vendor meeting and will be away the entire day.

Please let me know if I can continue with my current cohort under these circumstances. I appreciate your understanding and guidance.
