I noticed you're trying to commit a Kafka JAR file (~118 MB) directly into the GitHub repository, and ran into the 100 MB file size limit.
Just wanted to check — is there a reason we're not publishing the JAR to our internal JPMC Artifactory instead? If it's a custom or upgraded build of Kafka, we could upload it there and reference it in the pom.xml (or build.gradle) like we do with other dependencies.
Let me know if you need help getting it uploaded or configuring Maven to pull it from Artifactory — happy to assist. This approach would avoid GitHub size restrictions and is a cleaner long-term solution for managing large binaries.
