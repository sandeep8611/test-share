Risk and control
Haroon played an important role in bringing the 3rd Party Ingestion Image Pipeline (3PIIP) into production this year, enabling development teams to securely and efficiently ingest external images into the bank. Delivered under a tight deadline due to the Twistlock migration, 3PIIP replaced a legacy process that was less secure and prone to errors. Haroon also contributed significantly to enhancing 3PIIP by enabling Aqua scanning, which improved performance and reduced false positives. 

In addition, Haroon was instrumental in decommissioning RHEL7 and enabling UBI pipelines for RHEL8 and RHEL9, ensuring our pipelines remain secure and aligned with the latest Red Hat features and security patches. His efforts in migrating Middleware pipelines to RHEL8 and integrating Aqua scanning capabilities were pivotal for the successful decommissioning of Twistlock, providing developers access to more secure and reliable base images. Furthermore, Haroon has completed all required training on time, demonstrating his commitment to upholding risk and control standards.

By successfully bringing the 3rd Party Ingestion Image Pipeline (3PIIP) into production, development teams in JP now using a more streamlined and automated process for bringing external images into the bank. This transition significantly improved efficiency and reduced reliance on the slower, manual processes of the past. Furthermore, Haroon’s contributions to decommissioning RHEL7 and migrating pipelines from Twistlock to Aqua in JP this year resulted in substantial cost savings for the bank, reinforcing our commitment to optimising financial performance while maintaining secure and modern systems.

Client
This year, Haroon collaborated closely with family teams to incorporate their feedback into the development of the 3rd Party Ingestion Image Pipeline (3PIIP). His efforts ensured that 3PIIP was tailored to their specific use cases, delivering a seamless client experience prior to its launch into production. This proactive approach resulted in a positive experience for new teams adopting 3PIIP for securely ingesting external images into the bank.
Haroon also played a key role in onboarding new teams to 3PIIP and facilitating the migration of existing teams from the legacy process. His contributions were critical in fostering strong client relationships and ensuring a smooth and efficient transition. Furthermore, Haroon’s work in delivering observability metrics using Splunk for our pipelines has been instrumental in enhancing the overall client experience. These metrics provide valuable insights into pipeline usage by development teams, helping to identify and address bottlenecks while ensuring a reliable and efficient service.

Leadership
Haroon has been an integral member of the container security team over the past few years, consistently demonstrating a strong willingness to contribute and assist wherever needed. His support in onboarding Romeo, a new team member in the pipeline group, was instrumental in ensuring a smooth transition. Haroon provided valuable technical assistance that helped Romeo quickly get up to speed. Additionally, Haroon played a key role in the successful delivery of both the 3PIIP and UBI pipelines, gaining extensive experience in the end-to-end process of taking products into production.
As Haroon continues to grow in his role as SVP, he is now well-positioned to take on greater responsibility and technical ownership of the products he supports. By further developing his ability to manage ownership from engineering through to production, Haroon can strengthen his leadership presence. Additionally, focusing on building closer collaboration with stakeholders to address blockers and ensure efficient product delivery will enhance his influence and overall effectiveness within the team.
