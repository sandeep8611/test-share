Overall, the candidate demonstrated good knowledge and relevant experience. However, at times, their explanations were unclear, especially when discussing technical concepts like Multi-Stage and Dependency Injection. Instead of breaking down the concepts in simple terms, they focused on specific examples from past projects, which were overly complex and difficult to follow.

On the positive side, their understanding of REST APIs was strong, particularly around idempotency and the differences between PUT and POST, which many candidates struggle with. Additionally, their experience with Cloud/Kubernetes and overall engineering background is solid.

Based on their technical knowledge and past experience, I would recommend them for the role.
