Technical Lead for TITAN (Equities-Specific EV System)
Focus: Technical feasibility of implementing EV changes in TITAN. Key Questions:
	•	What challenges exist in modifying TITAN for backdated EV updates?
	•	How much effort would it take to make TITAN handle other asset classes?
	•	Are there performance constraints or architectural bottlenecks?
	•	What are the biggest integration challenges TITAN faces with EV calculations?
	•	What data sources and dependencies must be accounted for?
	•	Are there any technical constraints that impact this project?

Technical Lead for JEDI (Rates & Credit EV System)
Focus: Adapting JEDI to new EV calculations and integrations.
 Key Questions:
	•	Can JEDI support the new EV calculation methods (negative EV, sales split, etc.)?
	•	What dependencies does JEDI have with other systems (e.g., Sales Comp Tool, TFP)?
	•	How difficult is it to automate exception management in JEDI?
	•	What risks do you foresee in implementing these changes before year-end?
	•	How does JEDI currently interact with EV data, and what limitations exist?
	•	What technical enhancements would make EV processing more efficient?
	•	Are there any non-functional requirements we should be aware of (scalability, latency, etc.)?
