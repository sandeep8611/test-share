I wanted to touch base regarding the ongoing migration of the Middle team's pipelines to RHEL 8 and Aqua from Twistlock. While I appreciate the updates provided, I believe that understanding the complete work plan and all the tasks required to accomplish this activity for production is crucial for our planning and coordination.

From the recent communications, I understand that:

Testing in the development environment has been completed.
The ticket for RH8 VM Jenkins Agent setup has been promoted to UAT.
The EB UAT RH8 VMs are still under construction.
Additionally, there was a mention in an email about seeking existing RH8 binaries in the Artifactory repository. Could you please clarify the current status and the dependencies involved? Specifically, whom are we waiting on for the binaries, and what steps are pending from the EB side?

To ensure a smoother and more efficient process, could we arrange a meeting or have a detailed discussion to outline all tasks and milestones required to complete the migration to production? This will help us gauge the timeline accurately and address any potential blockers proactively.

Please note that I will be out of the office for a week starting [start date], and I will return on [return date]. It would be helpful to set up a discussion before my absence if possible. Otherwise, I can follow up promptly upon my return.
