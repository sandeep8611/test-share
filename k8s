Overall Assessment
While the candidate had some technical knowledge, it was mostly high-level rather than hands-on engineering experience. Additionally, communication was a major concern, as responses lacked clarity, were often vague or overly detailed, and required significant effort to extract the necessary information. Programming experience was also very limited.

Weaknesses

Lack of clarity in communication—took time to get direct answers, making it difficult to assess knowledge.
Responses were either too vague or too detailed, requiring follow-up questions to pinpoint understanding.
More high-level knowledge than practical engineering experience—technical understanding was present but lacked depth in real-world application.
Very limited programming experience.
