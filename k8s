Goal Title:
Enhancing VSaaS Scan Performance for Application Teams (Q1)

Goal Description:
Loads of application teams were experiencing timeouts in their CI builds when scanning their images with VSaaS. To address this issue, I have enhanced the scanning performance of VSaaS, reducing the likelihood of timeouts or extended durations during CI container scanning builds. Additionally, I have developed tutorials and knowledge documents to guide teams in building their container images with best practices.

Objectives:

Enhance VSaaS Scanning Performance:

Optimize the VSaaS scanning process to minimize timeouts and delays during CI builds.
Ensure a smoother and more efficient scanning experience for application teams.
Develop and Distribute Educational Resources:

Create comprehensive tutorials and knowledge documents to assist teams in building their container images effectively.
Promote best practices for container image creation and scanning.
Financial Performance Impact:
By shifting security measures to earlier in the development cycle, application teams can address vulnerabilities during CI builds rather than post-deployment. This proactive approach helps:

Reduce Remediation Costs: Fixing vulnerabilities early in the development cycle is significantly cheaper than addressing them post-deployment.
Decrease Development Time: Streamlining the VSaaS process reduces build times, accelerating the development cycle and enabling faster time-to-market for new features and products.
Enhance Productivity: Improved scan performance and readily available vulnerability reports enable developers to focus more on coding and less on troubleshooting build issues.
Mitigate Risks: Early detection and remediation of vulnerabilities reduce the risk of security breaches, protecting the organization from potential financial and reputational damage.
Outcomes:

Significant improvement in the VSaaS experience for application teams, leading to more efficient CI builds.
Streamlined workflows and enhanced overall efficiency for development teams.
Positive feedback from the CI team, evidencing the improvements made.
Attachments:

Feedback reviews received from the CI team.
