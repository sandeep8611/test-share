I believe there might be some miscommunication regarding our pipeline's capabilities. Our pipeline is not limited to supporting only 5 repositories; we have made enhancements to support a broader range of vendor repositories as previously discussed.

If the proposed plan you mentioned refers to this write-up (link here), I would like to reiterate that we have already outlined the constraints and challenges associated with this approach in our previous email (attached for reference). I have also discussed this matter with Sher, and we are both on the same page regarding its feasibility.

I am happy to further discuss this in our call scheduled for Wednesday, though I must express that we are unlikely to make progress with the current proposal. Additionally, I would be pleased to explain how we are currently supporting various repositories in our pipeline and address any questions you may have regarding the new pipeline.

Looking forward to our discussion.
