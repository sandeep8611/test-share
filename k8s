	•	Problem: The current Economic Value (EV) calculation system is fragmented, inconsistent, and dependent on the unmodifiable EOLDB, leading to inefficiencies and operational risks.
	•	Impact: The lack of a centralized and real-time validation system results in discrepancies across asset classes, increased manual interventions, and potential regulatory non-compliance???.
	⁃	Report is wrong

	•	Consequence:
	•	       EUC - COMPLIANCE way… register to EUC   Failure to enhance the system may lead to incorrect EV calculations, regulatory penalties??, operational bottlenecks, and reputational risks.
	⁃	overridden

	•	Urgency:
	•	With a year-end deadline for regulatory compliance and growing complexity in EV methodologies, an immediate solution is required to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and risk mitigation.
