Weâ€™ve implemented rate limiting in our Scanning API as part of our security-first approach. This ensures stability and prevents abuse by limiting the number of scans a user can perform per hour. By controlling request frequency, we protect against brute force attacks, resource exhaustion, and denial-of-service incidents while ensuring reliable performance for all users.
