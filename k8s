Subject: Handover Update for Upcoming Week

Dear Team,

As I will be out for the upcoming week, I wanted to provide a quick handover update to ensure our progress on the projects continues smoothly. Here is a brief overview of a few important milestones and responsibilities during my absence:

Pipelines (Romeo, Haroon)
General Update:
While the teams using the old process are already migrating, new teams are also onboarding into 3PIP. Itâ€™s essential that we adhere to our support model and self-service documentation to facilitate a seamless onboarding experience for users without unnecessary support.

3rd Party Pipeline Aqua Migration:

Romeo: You are overseeing the Aqua migration for the 3rd party pipeline.
Middle Pipeline Aqua Migration:

Haroon: Please ensure that the Middle team is migrating to Aqua. Make sure to follow up with them daily, as this is the biggest risk in the Twistlock migration.
I have requested detailed steps for the migration to RHEL 8 and Aqua from the Middle team. Please follow up and ensure the remaining tasks are completed. This is a critical path task and will become a blocker if Twistlock is shut down by the end of next month.
New Teams Onboarding/Migration:

Crowdstrike Daemon Set Image: The team will refer to our documentation for onboarding.
Qualys Image: Mike will coordinate with his vendor to onboard the Qualys image into the 3rd Party pipeline.
For any questions or blockers, please reach out to Noor.
VSaaS (Chris) - Aqua Migration
Progress: Chris is actively managing the migration of CSIs, and the process is going well. We will continue with a gradual migration of new CSIs.
Backlog Management
Stories: I have created a few stories, and additional stories are in the priority backlog. Please review and prioritize accordingly.
Should any issues or questions arise, do not hesitate to contact Chris.
Thank you for your support and cooperation. Please ensure these tasks are managed diligently in my absence.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
