 noticed that the subject of the upcoming meeting is "to bring images through 3rd party pipeline." Could you please expand on the purpose of the meeting? Specifically, I would like to understand what topics or questions you aim to address.

Additionally, if you have specific questions or issues, would it be possible to address them via email, or is a meeting necessary to discuss them in detail?
