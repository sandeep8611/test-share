Hi [User's Name],

Thank you for reaching out. The rate limit is in place to ensure fair usage and system stability. To better understand your use case and see if an exception is needed, could you please provide the following details?

Pipeline Details – Is this part of a regular CI/CD pipeline, or is it a one-time bulk scan?
FID (if applicable) – This helps us track your request.
Scan Volume – How many scans are you running, and at what frequency?
Once we have this information, we can evaluate whether a whitelist exception is appropriate or if an alternative solution is needed.

Looking forward to your response.
