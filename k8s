Dear ,

I am pleased to share the feedback regarding my recent collaboration with Ali on enhancing the VSaaS scan image.

Through our joint efforts, we achieved significant improvements, including:

Enhanced VSaaS Scan Performance: Together, we implemented several changes to the VSaaS scan images, significantly reducing the likelihood of application teams experiencing timeouts or delays.
Image Size Reduction: We successfully optimized the image size by over 1GB. This reduction will enhance the performance of our CI pipeline, given the frequent use of these images.
These improvements will directly benefit the development team by providing a faster and more efficient development experience. I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Ali on this project and look forward to continued teamwork.

Best regards,
