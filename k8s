I have recently transitioned from an individual developer to a technical lead and manager role, overseeing a team of five and managing four products: VSaaS, 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware Pipelines. My goal is to enhance my leadership capabilities while maintaining and expanding my technical expertise.

One Year:

Solidify my leadership position by focusing on team building, effective communication, and trust development.
Deepen my technical understanding of VSaaS, 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware Pipelines, contributing to their technical design and architecture.
Identify and address skill gaps within my team, creating individual development plans.


Five Years:

Advance to a senior leadership role, potentially managing multiple teams or departments.
Drive innovation and identify new business opportunities.
