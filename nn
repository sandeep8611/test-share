VSaaS/Snyk Migration - $10 Million Savings Over 3 Years
As part of our ongoing commitment to engineering excellence and enhancing cyber capabilities, I successfully led the migration of the VSaaS API from Clair to Snyk. This migration, which supports greater use and reliability across multiple sectors, resulted in the following measurable outcomes:
	1	Operational Efficiency and Risk Management:
	◦	Achieved a remarkable reduction in failure rates from 3% with Clair to just 0.2% with Snyk, significantly enhancing our cybersecurity risk management. This improvement has contributed to a more robust and resilient vulnerability scanning process, directly supporting the organization's objective of maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture.
	2	Productivity Gains:
	◦	By reducing scan times by over 75% (from 173 seconds to just 42 seconds), we significantly increased developer productivity, aligning with our goal to drive engineering excellence. This reduction not only saved time but also improved feedback loops, allowing for faster and more reliable security scans.
	3	Cross-Functional Collaboration:
	◦	As part of the transition to Snyk, I partnered closely with teams across ICG, CTO, and CIB Cyber, ensuring the seamless integration of the CI Tekton pipelines with VSaaS Snyk. This transition guaranteed that 100% of our internal container images are now scanned for vulnerabilities using Snyk's enhanced capabilities across JP Morgan.
	◦	Scalability and Efficiency: We are currently conducting approximately 76,000 VSaaS scans per month, all with Snyk, resulting in higher-quality scan results and fewer false positives compared to the previous Clair system.
	◦	CI Tekton Pipeline Integration and Timeout Resolution: In addition to transitioning to Snyk, I addressed performance bottlenecks that were causing timeouts for application teams, particularly in LightSpeed Enterprise builds. By implementing enhancements to the VSaaS scan process, including optimized timeout settings and providing best practices for building container images, we significantly improved scan performance. As a result, over 90% of scans now complete within the CI Tekton build, with vulnerability reports readily available in real-time. This reduced the risk of build failures and saved multi-minutes on release builds, ultimately improving developer productivity.
	◦	Developer Productivity and Risk Mitigation: Shifting security measures earlier in the development cycle allowed application teams to address vulnerabilities during LightSpeed Enterprise builds, rather than post-deployment. This streamlined the VSaaS process, shortened build times, and accelerated the development cycle, enabling faster time-to-market for new features while also mitigating security risks.
	4	Long-Term Cost Savings:
	◦	The migration project is projected to deliver $10 million in savings over the next three years by decommissioning Clair. This outcome demonstrates our ability to drive long-term value, aligning with the organization’s financial objectives while improving both security and operational efficiency.

By integrating advanced scanning capabilities and enhancing risk control mechanisms, this accomplishment supports the broader goal of maintaining our cybersecurity risk appetite, while also contributing to organizational priorities like collaboration, engineering excellence, and long-term financial performance.


3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware Pipelines Transition to Snyk
In alignment with my commitment to engineering excellence and cost optimization, I successfully led the migration of the 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP), UBI, and Middleware pipelines from Clair to Snyk. This transition supports enhanced security scanning and operational efficiency across multiple pipelines, driving measurable outcomes for the organization:
	1	Operational Efficiency and Risk Management:
	◦	Fully transitioned 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware pipelines to use Snyk instead of Clair for backend scanning, resulting in more reliable and accurate vulnerability assessments. This improvement strengthened our cybersecurity posture, ensuring robust scanning for all third-party and middleware components.
	2	Leadership and Cross-Functional Collaboration:
	◦	With Clair set to be decommissioned by the end of September, it was imperative to transition the Middleware pipeline to support Snyk. Failure to complete this migration would have left the pipeline blocked, posing significant security risks for the bank and preventing the provision of secure, up-to-date base images for development teams. Despite multiple challenges and technical blockers, the project was at risk of missing the deadline. I took ownership of this critical situation, partnering with the Middleware pipeline’s leadership and technical leads, and brought together key stakeholders including CTI, CTO, operations, Jenkins teams, and change management teams. By spearheading the migration process, I ensured each blocker was prioritized by the relevant teams, chased down issues, and coordinated testing for the Development, UAT, and Production pipelines. My leadership in driving this process was crucial to meeting the deadline, thus mitigating potential security risks associated with the decommissioning of Clair.
	3	Enhanced UBI Pipeline:
	◦	Enhanced the UBI Pipeline to support the latest RHEL 8 and 9 versions, resolving a critical blocker caused by the discontinuation of RHEL 7 support by the Linux team. This upgrade was essential for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring that our pipelines remain compatible with the latest security standards.
	4	Cost Savings:
	◦	By transitioning our pipelines—3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware—completely to Snyk, this initiative is projected to deliver $1 million in savings over the next three years as Clair is decommissioned. This reflects my commitment to driving long-term value through technology optimization and improved security measures.
Through leading this complex transition and coordinating across multiple teams, I made significant contributions to the organization's broader objectives of Cybersecurity Risk Appetite, engineering excellence, cost efficiency, and strengthening our overall cybersecurity posture. This proactive approach not only reduced potential risks but also reinforced our commitment to maintaining high standards of security within our development processes, safeguarding our infrastructure, and ensuring continued operational effectiveness.

Grafeas Decommissioning and Migration to Aqua
I successfully led the migration from Grafeas to Aqua for storing custom severity data, integrating the process across key container security products such as VSaaS, 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP), UBI Pipeline, and Middleware Pipelines. This transition eliminated all dependencies on Grafeas. As part of this effort, I spearheaded the design and implementation of a fully functional Grafeas-replacement library and delivered modernized versions of CVE Review Automation and Image Validation scripts, fully aligned with Aqua’s advanced capabilities.
Throughout the migration, I ensured a seamless transition of custom severity data, working closely with cross-functional teams to minimize disruption to vulnerability scanning operations and VA team assessments.
