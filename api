Noor — quick heads-up regarding the Malware API integration.
Avtar has likely already reached out, but at the moment we’re not getting the required support from Riad’s team (Tom’s response was unclear, and Marek is still OOO). The Swagger specification lacks sufficient documentation, and the API behavior remains unclear.
The questions Romeo raised (input requirements, mandatory SPDX/CycloneDX fields, response interpretation, API maturity and availability, async UUID behavior, and use of the provided BOMs) are foundational integration questions. Without clarity on these, we cannot properly assess effort, define the integration design, or implement reliable blocking logic in our ingestion pipeline.
Tom indicated these items are in their sprint backlog starting Monday, but we have not received concrete answers or a clear plan yet.
We will need clearer documentation and technical support from their side before Avtar can confidently run a roadmap discussion and provide sizing for this work.
Flagging early to help manage expectations.
