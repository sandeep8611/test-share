Roadmap nic 

Haroon stepped into the Product Owner role for the FITR project mid-year after Chris’s retirement and successfully guided it to production. He demonstrated strong leadership by collaborating with the MW team to improve base images across all languages and by driving delivery of the UBI 9 Minimal initiative. He has also ensured the stability of critical container security services, including the 3PiiP pipeline, supporting ongoing operational continuity for our users.
As he continues to grow into his role as SVP, I expect Haroon to take full ownership of his workstreams and proactively lead them by ensuring roadmaps and JIRA items are well defined. I would also like to see him engage more closely with teams such as Aqua and other key stakeholders, mentor and guide team members, and elevate the visibility of our work through client demos and presentations. Additionally, taking broader accountability such as identifying high-priority workstreams, contributing to overall team objectives, and supporting delivery across the team will further strengthen his leadership impact. Expanding his ownership beyond core areas will position him well to broaden his portfolio and grow as a senior leader in the team.
Risk
Haroon proactively identified potential risks during the migration from Enterprise Jenkins to Open Source Jenkins and took steps to ensure pipeline stability throughout the transition, minimizing impact to our users. He also completed all required training on time.
Earlier in the year, there was a breach of the firm’s Personal Trading and Investment Policy, which has been discussed with Haroon. He is expected to fully comply with this and all firm policies going forward. There have been no further incidents since, demonstrating his continued adherence to compliance expectations and a strengthened sense of accountability.

Fin
Haroon contributed to the integration of VTM Best Practice rules into our pipelines, helping to automate the previously manual Vulnerability Assessment (VA) review process. This work has significantly improved efficiency by reducing reliance on manual reviews and delivering faster, more consistent feedback to our users. Additionally, the 3PIIP pipeline success rate increased from approximately 44% to 96%, and image ingestion times were reduced from days to minutes on average. He also played an important role in ensuring a smooth transition of our services—including 3PIIP, MW, and UBI pipelines—during the firmwide migration from Enterprise Jenkins to Open Source Jenkins, a change contributing to over $1MM in annual licensing savings.


Client
Haroon successfully delivered the UBI9 Minimal hardened image, providing users with a lightweight and secure base that reduces the overall attack surface. He also continues to support users of the 3PIIP pipelines, ensuring reliability and responsiveness.
As a senior member of the team, Haroon is encouraged to further expand his visibility and stakeholder engagement. Proactively sharing product updates through demos or presentations with wider JP teams, and engaging more closely with key stakeholders across and beyond the team, would help increase awareness of our services and strengthen his cross-team relationships and professional network.

====
Romeo has performed well this year, settling into his role and contributing not only to pipeline development but also to broader areas of our container security products. He has demonstrated strong initiative by stepping outside his comfort zone to support projects such as VSaaS and AquaSec. He also showed effective leadership through his collaboration with the MW team to improve base images across all languages and by driving delivery of the UBI 9 Micro initiative. Additionally, he has played an important role in ensuring the stability of critical container security services, including the 3PiiP pipeline, helping maintain operational continuity for our users. Romeo has also taken on mentoring responsibilities with Oyin, involving him in meaningful work on the 3PiiP pipeline.
As he continues to grow, I encourage Romeo to further strengthen his engagement with internal team members and key stakeholders. Expanding his accountability, contributing to broader team objectives, and supporting delivery across the team will continue to enhance his leadership impact.
Risk
Romeo proactively identifies risks associated with external changes, such as the Artifactory federated instance migration and the Jenkins migration. In both cases, he played a key role in ensuring our container security services continued to operate seamlessly for users. He also took preventive action by blocking RHEL 7 in the MW pipeline to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, he completed all required training on time.

Financial

Romeo contributed to the integration of VTM Best Practice rules into our pipelines, automating the previously manual Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process. This work is expected to significantly improve efficiency by reducing manual effort and providing faster, more consistent feedback to users. He also played a key role in improving the 3PIIP pipeline, increasing success rates from approximately 44% to 96% and reducing image ingestion times from days to minutes on average.
Romeo additionally supported Noor with the CSI migration for VSaaS, which was delivered well ahead of schedule. He also played an important role in ensuring a smooth transition of our services—including 3PIIP, MW, and UBI pipelines—during the firmwide migration from Enterprise Jenkins to Open Source Jenkins, a change contributing to over $1MM in annual licensing savings.
His contributions to engineering excellence—such as developing an automated testing framework for Aqua and onboarding tools like Renovate and Squad—have further strengthened the team’s operational efficiency, quality, and long-term maintainability.
Client
omeo plays an important role in developing new features for our pipeline services and providing critical support to users. He consistently ensures that user queries are addressed effectively and that clients receive clear guidance on onboarding and using our pipelines. His contribution to the migration of our pipelines to the Artifactory federated instance reflects strong ownership and a willingness to engage beyond his core responsibilities—including developing an understanding of Aqua and supporting its migration. His presentation on UBI Micro during the Hands-on call was a valuable way to increase visibility of our work, and I encourage him to continue sharing updates and insights through similar forums.
Looking ahead, Romeo’s continued focus on user engagement, proactive communication, and collaboration beyond pipeline-specific tasks will help broaden his impact and further strengthen relationships with our clients and stakeholders.
