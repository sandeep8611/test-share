Understand the current Gating service implemented in the LSE pipeline, engage with service owners, and define the integration and onboarding approach required to incorporate VSaaS (Image Scanning API) into the existing gating workflow.
Description
The LSE pipeline already contains a functional Gating service that enforces compliance checks prior to image promotion. Before implementing VSaaS-based gating, the team must fully evaluate the existing architecture, workflows, policy evaluation logic, ownership model, and integration points.
This story establishes those baselines, identifies constraints or gaps, and results in a documented onboarding plan that outlines how VSaaS will be incorporated into the LSE gating service without disrupting current functionality.
Activities include stakeholder engagement, architectural review, API compatibility assessment, and mapping of VSaaS scan outputs into the LSE Gating decision engine.
Objectives
Map the current LSE Gating service architecture and process flow.
Identify required touchpoints for integrating VSaaS scanning and gating logic.
Establish relationships and responsibilities between VSaaS team and LSE pipeline maintainers.
Define an actionable onboarding plan for VSaaS integration into the existing Gating service.
Acceptance Criteria
Documentation describing the current LSE Gating service, including:
Architecture, workflow, and gating decision sequence
Data and artifact inputs required for gating
Current policies and severity thresholds
Integration points and dependencies
Meeting(s) completed with relevant LSE Gating service owners and CI/CD maintainers.
Compatibility assessment of VSaaS scan outputs with LSE gating logic completed and documented.
A documented onboarding plan created that includes:
Required integration changes
Data mappings (VSaaS scan results → Gating service inputs)
Sequence diagram or flow defining how VSaaS will plug into gating
Estimated engineering effort and timeline
Risks, constraints, or architectural gaps identified and captured.
Story accepted after review with both VSaaS team and LSE pipeline owners.
Deliverables
LSE Gating service assessment report (architecture + workflow).
Stakeholder map and engagement summary.
VSaaS integration onboarding plan.
Updated documentation repository containing findings.
