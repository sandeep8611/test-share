I delivered meaningful cost savings and efficiency gains across the container-security estate by decommissioning legacy CSI and the VSaaS–Twistlock platform, automating manual controls, and modernising release workflows with RoD—while keeping services reliable for users and application teams. Highlights include an early VSaaS CSI cutover (ahead of plan), eliminating a ~$1.2M/year enterprise license by moving all pipelines to open-source Jenkins, and replacing multi-day manual validations with instant, automated gating aligned to the new VTM Best Practices.
VSaaS CSI ID migration & cutover (delivered early) Migrated VSaaS from Twistlock CSI ID to AquaSec CSI ID in Q2 (planned Q3) and decommissioned the old CSI resources—reducing run costs and eliminating legacy dependencies while maintaining production service standards.
Migration from Enterprise Jenkins to open-source Jenkins Moved 3PIIP, Middleware, and UBI pipelines off CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise to open-source Jenkins, removing a ~$1.2MM annual license and advancing our modernisation and cost-reduction strategy.
VSaaS & pipeline enhancements with VTM Best Practices: Aligned 3PIIP ingestion and VSaaS visibility to VTM standards; introduced GEM/exploitability gating and telemetry, replacing multi-day manual VA reviews with instant automation. VSaaS now surfaces pre-gating signals to accelerate decisions. Impact: freed the VA team for higher-value work; 3PIIP pass rate ~44% → 96%; ingestion latency for previously delayed images cut from ~3.55 days → <10 minutes—fewer blockers for app teams and faster time-to-market.

Release on Demand (RoD) + PTS for AquaSec Partnered with Adam to onboard AquaSec to RoD and integrate PTS, Tekton, and Harness, achieving fully automated deployments and compliance evidence. Result: removing manual, error-prone steps, accelerating release throughput, and reducing audit overhead.
