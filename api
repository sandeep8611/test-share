1. Context & Objective
The Container Security team owns VSaaS (Vulnerability Scanning as a Service), which provides container image scanning via the VSaaS API. VSaaS is currently integrated into Lightspeed CI pipelines (and other pipelines) and delivers actionable vulnerability findings to developers as part of a shift‑left security model.
The objective of this discussion was to:
Understand the existing enterprise Gating service currently used by Snyk
Evaluate how VSaaS can onboard into this Gating service
Clarify inputs, expectations, and ownership across teams
The goal is to enable mandatory gating for container images that do not meet VSaaS security thresholds (VTM standard).
2. Current State – Enterprise Gating Service (As‑Is)
Based on discussions with the Gating Service team (Ray and Anzi) and prior alignment with the Snyk team:
Lightspeed CI – Feature Branch
Gating Service is not currently used for gating in CI feature branch pipelines.
CI/CD – Release/Main Branch
Gating Service is used in CD (Harness) to enforce gates.
Gating results are surfaced in the Lightspeed UI Gates tab.
Failed gates can be overridden via an Opt‑Out / Exception process using OneApproval.
Snyk is a production reference implementation of this flow.
3. VSaaS Scanning & Proposed Gating Flow
VSaaS scans container images after the image is built and pushed to Artifactory during the Lightspeed CI build.
VSaaS produces a detailed JSON scan report including:
Exploitable CVEs
GEM findings
Assurance policy violations
Other vulnerability metadata
Sample VSaaS scan reports (pass/fail) were shared for reference.
The proposal discussed is:
VSaaS to participate in CD gating, similar to Snyk
Where feasible, VSaaS results may also be displayed in the LightSpeed UI Gates tab
4. Integration Discussion & Open Clarifications
In CD (Harness), the Gating Service orchestrates calls to scanning services (e.g., Snyk, VSaaS).
The Gating Service requires certain inputs from Lightspeed CI to initiate scan result evaluation.
For VSaaS, the only required input is the container image name(s) built during the Lightspeed CI run.
Lightspeed already passes image name today to VSaaS API during LSE CI Build for image scanning.
There is an expectation from the Gating Service team that:
Each scanning service exposes an API endpoint that the Gating Service can call to retrieve scan results and determine gating status.
The VSaaS team shared:
A sample VSaaS JSON response currently returned to developers.
Open Question to Ray's team (Gating Service team):
Is the current VSaaS JSON response sufficient for direct consumption by the Gating Service, or are additional fields / transformations required?

6. Open Questions (Action‑Oriented)
Gating Service team to answer - What is the formal onboarding contract for new scanning services into the Gating service?
Gating Service team to answer - What changes, if any, are required in VSaaS API responses for gating consumption?
Which team owns onboarding delivery and roadmap commitment for VSaaS gating?
7. Next Steps (Proposed)
Gating Service team to review the shared VSaaS JSON response and confirm compatibility or required changes.
VSaaS and Gating Service teams to conduct a focused technical deep‑dive on integration specifics.
Define and document a VSaaS onboarding approach into the existing Gating service.
Align ownership and timeline for onboarding VSaaS into gating.
8. Ask from VSaaS Team
We would like to align on clear next steps and ownership to ensure VSaaS is formally onboarded into the enterprise Gating service and included in relevant team roadmaps
VSaaS gating is a mandatory security control aligned to VTM standards and is required to be onboarded using the existing enterprise Gating service, similar to Snyk
