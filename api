Hi Team,
As we approach the holiday season in July and August, I just wanted to open up a quick conversation around planning time off. These are key months when many of us may be taking holidays, and weâ€™ll also be saying goodbye to Chris, which will be a big change for the team.

If you're thinking about booking time off during this period, could we please have a quick chat first? It would really help us ensure we have the right coverage to continue supporting our products and users smoothly.

Thanks so much for your understanding and collaboration!
