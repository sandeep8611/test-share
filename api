Noor – this work stream is still in the design phase. Romeo has already tested manual failover deployment to another console in VSaaS (in Dev). Based on our discussion, we’re now exploring an automated failover solution, but that introduces additional challenges. Q4 is still my target, though the exact delivery will depend on which solution path we finalize. Once the design is complete, I’ll share a clearer timeline and risk assessment. For now, would it be possible to exclude this from the committed scope until the design is finalized?"
