Hi Team,
There is a GenAI pathway available on Degreed that I believe would be valuable for our ongoing work and skill development.
If possible, could we consider adding a sprint task to go through the GenAI Degreed pathway below during this sprint? If that is not feasible due to current priorities, perhaps we could at least align on a plan or target timeline to complete it soon.

Please let me know your thoughts.
