I wanted to provide a brief update on a few items:
I have completed the manager review with Romeo, which means all manager reviews for my team are now finalized.
Romeo raised one piece of feedback related to the Financial category. As you know, it is often challenging to set clear expectations for achieving ratings of 1 or 2 in this area, particularly given our team’s focus on Container Security. I thought his feedback was constructive, and I had discussed a similar point with Chris previously. I addressed Romeo’s concern for now, but I told him I would also speak with you in January and follow up with him afterward.
I had a 1:1 with Noor, and he reiterated his interest in relocating to a JPMC location in the US. I informed him that there are no opportunities in our team at the moment but suggested he connect with you to explore whether any options may exist more broadly. He may reach out to you directly.
