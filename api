Automating VSaaS Release Process with RoD and PTS Integration to Improve Operational Controls and Reduce Risk
One of the significant challenges in the production release process for Vulnerability Scanning as a Service (VSaaS) was the complex, time-consuming, and risk-prone manual submission of compliance documents. This led to unnecessary delays, resource constraints, and operational risks. The process required substantial time from operational teams, involving manual evidence collection and documentation to ensure Project Tracking System (PTS) compliance.

To address these challenges, I took ownership of integrating Release-on-Demand (RoD) with PTS, fully automating the release process. This initiative not only streamlined compliance but also reduced manual effort significantly, enabling faster, audit-compliant releases. By expanding RoD’s capabilities beyond the ICG sector, I laid the foundation for broader adoption, contributing to improved operational efficiency across the firm.

Problem & Impact
	•	Time-Consuming Manual Processes: Each production release for VSaaS previously required up to a week due to manual tasks in change ticket creation/approval and evidence submission for audit purposes. This delayed releases, increased labor costs, and introduced operational risks, with potential compliance vulnerabilities.
	•	High Compliance Costs: Meeting PTS compliance standards involved labor-intensive manual collection of artifacts for auditing. This raised operational costs and slowed down time-to-market for critical updates, affecting engineering productivity and delaying feature delivery.

Solution: RoD Integration and Automation
To mitigate risks and enhance operational controls, I led the following initiative:
	•	RoD Integration with PTS: I spearheaded a cross-functional effort, working with key stakeholders across RoD (Daniel), PTS (Charla), PQA (Julie), and PMO (Terri) to fully automate the release process. This involved enhancing CTI Jira workflows to align with RoD’s templates, automating everything from change ticket creation to approvals. All compliance documentation was auto-generated and uploaded to PTS, eliminating the need for any manual steps. This improved communication across teams and ensured a smooth transition to automated processes.
	•	End-to-End Automation: By integrating RoD and automating the PTS compliance and audit submission process, I reduced release times from a week to just one day. The automated process transformed the release workflow, significantly reducing operational risk, improving audit compliance, and lowering resource overhead. This shift also freed engineering resources to focus on strategic priorities, while ensuring full audit compliance without manual intervention.

Key Achievements:
	•	Increased Efficiency, Agility, and Reduced Toil: The automation reduced the release process from a week to a single day, ensuring full compliance with PTS and PQA standards while minimizing human error in regulatory submissions. This allowed engineering resources to focus on higher-value tasks and strategic initiatives. As a result, multiple VSaaS releases can now occur in a single day, speeding up time-to-market and enhancing developer productivity. By automating tasks such as ServiceNow ticket creation, approvals, and PTS uploads, I have eliminated bottlenecks and enhanced responsiveness to market demands while maintaining audit compliance with zero manual intervention.
	•	Scalability Across Multiple Sectors: Initially restricted to the ICG sector, I collaborated with stakeholders to extend RoD usage across CISO and additional sectors. This broad implementation allowed teams across the organization to benefit from the risk mitigation and compliance automation capabilities, enhancing the firm’s risk management framework at a larger scale and driving efficiency.
	•	Driving Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Controls Excellence: The RoD integration with our VSaaS project, including the LightSpeed pipeline, Bitbucket, Jira, Harness deployment, and ServiceNow group, improved operational controls, ensuring adherence to PMO quality standards and audit requirements. The enhanced controls significantly reduce the risk of non-compliance, improving transparency in release operations and ensuring that every release is properly documented and compliant. This project reinforces the firm's commitment to engineering excellence and strengthens our cybersecurity risk management, aligning with audit and regulatory standards.
Feedback and Recognition:
The integration of RoD into the PTS system has received positive feedback from various teams:

	•	“A round of applause for ABC and DEF who were able to successfully get the PTS artifacts uploaded with RoDtoday for the first time from their release. Great work, guys!” — Charla
	•	“Outstanding—great work all!” — Michael
	•	“On a serious note, great job on the collaboration! I'm glad RoD is getting more and more traction with other sectors. It seems to be a win-win across the board.” — Laurie

Strengthening Operational Support and Controls for VSaaS and 3PIIP

1. Enhancing Operational Efficiency for VSaaS
In my role managing the operational support for VSaaS, I optimized both the support structure and processes to improve efficiency and control:
	•	Created a clear separation of responsibilities between engineers and support teams, allowing each group to focus on its core functions.
	•	Defined operational standards and support processes, including SLAs for L1 support tickets, which led to faster resolution times.
	•	Established a dedicated ServiceNow support group to streamline ticket management, ensuring faster responses and better prioritization.
	•	Designed an onboarding system for new support team members to ensure they had the necessary access and controls in place, as well as comprehensive training on the VSaaS environment.
Impact: These initiatives reduced the operational burden on engineers, increased support team responsiveness, and drove significant operational efficiency and resource optimization.

2. Automating the 3PIIP Support Model to Scale Operations and Mitigate Risk
Faced with the challenge of no dedicated support team for the 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP) project, I designed and implemented an automated support model that met the critical August production deadline:
	•	Developed an automated ticketing system with a dedicated support email group and templates to streamline the handling of support tickets.
	•	Created a centralized support channel in Microsoft Teams, improving collaboration and response times.
	•	Introduced a data-driven approach to categorize and analyze support tickets, addressing recurring issues proactively and improving pipeline stability.
This innovative model allowed us to:
	•	Successfully migrate over 30 teams from a old manual ingestion process to the new 3PIIP platform and 20 new onboard teams, driving broader firm adoption.
	•	Seamlessly transition existing teams while minimizing downtime and operational disruptions.
Impact: The automation of support processes significantly reduced operational risk, enhanced scalability, and strengthen risk management and operational agility.

3. Developing a Scalable Observability and Monitoring Framework
To further improve the stability and security of both VSaaS and 3PIIP, I implemented and delivered a comprehensive observability framework:
	•	Integrated Kibana, Splunk, and AppDynamics to provide real-time insights into system health, allowing the support team to monitor key services proactively.
	•	Designed a custom monitoring and alerting system for dependencies like Aqua, Artifactory, and S3, ensuring that any issues impacting the VSaaS and Pipelines were identified and resolved immediately.
This framework has:
	•	Increased visibility into the health of both systems, allowing for faster issue resolution.
	•	Reduced downtime and improved system reliability by alerting the team to potential problems before they escalated.
Impact: The observability solution supported my commitment to engineering excellence and cybersecurity by providing the tools needed for efficient, proactive support model to increase system visibility, reduce downtime, improve reliability.

Summary of Impact
Through my leadership in automating support models, establishing operational standards, and implementing advanced monitoring systems, I enhanced the overall efficiency and security of the VSaaS and 3PIIP platforms. These contributions support automation, risk reduction, and engineering excellence, and have created a scalable framework for continued growth and operational stability.
