uick update from my discussion with Pravesh regarding Jenkins.
Their team is driving a strategic move from Jenkins to Tekton.
Our 3PiiP External Ingestion pipeline (Jenkins) is an official/approved use case, and they confirmed there will be no immediate plug-off and no impact without prior notice.
Pravesh mentioned a new strategic ingestion solution called “Cinedal” (Romeo is also involved), which they see as the long-term direction for ingestion use cases.
Timeline is not immediate — likely 1–2 quarters.
Pravesh said he will work with us and share more details; I’ll pass those along once available.
At this stage, there isn’t enough clarity to add migration or re-platforming work for 3PiiP into our roadmap given current priorities. I’ll also speak with Haroon and Romeo tomorrow, but any addition of this stream would likely require deprioritizing existing roadmap items.
