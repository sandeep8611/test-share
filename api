Revised Responses to the Questions:

Human-Friendly vs. Machine-Friendly Formats:

The image size, duration, and other numerical values should strictly be numeric in all responses (e.g., 100.0 for image size). Units like "MB" or "seconds" should be included in human-readable reports, not in API responses.
Action Taken: This issue has been addressed in a local branch, and MB has been removed from responses.
Minimal Information Per Response:

We should provide a summary tabular report in the API response, as it is the primary report users should refer to. Other formats like JSON and CSV can be linked within this tabular report for those who need them.
Environment Information: We can review and possibly remove fields like env or cluster if they are no longer necessary, ensuring a lean and focused API response.
Consistent vs. Specific Endpoint Design:

Each endpoint serves different purposes (e.g., scan, status, report) and should return specific information relevant to its function. Common data should be referenced rather than duplicated.
Clarification Needed: Ensure clarity in endpoint documentation so users understand what data to expect from each endpoint.
