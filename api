The VSaaS report is now fully integrated with FITR and has been enhanced to include a detailed image-layer breakdown by ancestry. Image Assurance Policies have been incorporated directly into the VSaaS report. The solution has been deployed in the development environment for testing and validation. Progress continues on upgrading MW images to UBI 9 Minimal, with Java and Python (Miniconda) images already completed. Overall unit test coverage has been increased to enhance reliability, and the base image, libraries, and packages have been upgraded to the latest secure versions.
