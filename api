We've made several updates to the vSaaS project this month: the Python base image has been upgraded to the latest version; error messages for image scan failures (especially pre-condition failures like unsupported registries) now include the image name for better clarity; and package dependencies such as spicy, too, coverage, and flake8 have been updated to their latest versions. We've also migrated our Dockerfile to use the federated registry. All these changes are available in UAT and are scheduled for production release in the coming days.
