Haroon has stepped up to take on temporary Product Owner responsibilities for the FITR project, demonstrating strong ownership and a willingness to expand his leadership portfolio. As a senior member of the team, he is expected to continue growing his impact and driving delivery on our quarterly commitments. His accountability, ownership, and contributions beyond his core areas will position him well to broaden his portfolio and make an even greater impact in the second half of the year.

Haroon proactively raised potential risks related to the Enterprise Jenkins to Open Source Jenkins migration and is actively working to ensure pipeline stability throughout the transition, minimizing any impact to users. He completed his required training on time. It will be important for Haroon to stay consistently on top of compliance reporting, as there have been a few instances where outstanding items were flagged.

  Haroon contributed to the integration of VTM Best Practice rules into our pipelines, helping to automate the previously manual Vulnerability Assessment (VA) review process. This work is expected to significantly improve efficiency by reducing reliance on manual reviews and providing faster, more consistent feedback to our users.


Haroon successfully delivered the UBI 9 Minimal hardened image for our users, providing a lightweight and secure base that helps reduce the overall attack surface. He also continues to support users of the 3PIIP pipelines. As a senior member of the team, Haroon is encouraged to further expand his visibility and stakeholder engagement. For example, proactively sharing product updates through demos or presentations with wider JPMC teams would not only increase awareness of our services but also help strengthen his cross-team relationships and professional network.


Romeo has performed well in the first half of the year, settling into his role and beginning to contribute beyond pipelines into other areas of our products. As he continues to grow, I encourage him to maintain focus on strengthening his engagement with both internal team members and our stakeholders. In the second half of the year, building broader relationships and maintaining strong delivery focus will be especially important as we navigate the transition following the departure of a key team member. Romeo’s continued development in these areas will be critical to minimising gaps and supporting the overall success of the team.


Romeo  proactively look at the risk that could arise due to inevitable situation like Artifactory Federated instance migration, Jenkins Migration. In both instances, he is playing a key role ensuring our container security products are not impacting to our users. This also shows his proactive risk mitigation for our products. He also completed his trainings and other compliance on time. 


Romeo contributed to the integration of VTM Best Practice rules into our pipelines, helping to automate the previously manual Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process. This work is expected to significantly improve efficiency by reducing reliance on manual reviews and delivering faster, more consistent feedback to users. He also helped Noor to the CSI migration for VSaaS when needed, which was delivered well ahead of the original timeline. In addition, his efforts in advancing engineering excellence—such as developing automated testing framework for Aqua, and onboarding tools like Renovate and Squad—have been instrumental to our team’s progress. Continuing to drive improvements in these areas will be key to our success in the second half of the year.


Romeo plays an important role in both developing features for our pipeline services and providing critical support to our users. He supports user queries and ensures they receive the right guidance for onboarding and effective use of our pipelines. His contribution to the migration of our pipelines to the Artifactory federated instance demonstrates his ownership mindset and willingness to engage beyond his core responsibilities—including gaining an understanding of Aqua and supporting its migration. Romeo’s ongoing support for our users and involvement in areas beyond pipelines will help broaden his impact and further strengthen relationships with our clients and stakeholders.


Noor is an exceptionally talented member of the team, consistently delivering high-quality technical outcomes for our products. To further accelerate his growth, Noor is encouraged to take greater end-to-end ownership of workstreams, driving initiatives independently and expanding his scope beyond technical execution. Building stronger relationships with our clients, partner teams such as Operations and SRE, and broader stakeholders will be key to his continued development. His participation in the E3 program this year will be a valuable opportunity to strengthen these leadership capabilities and broaden his impact.

Noor consistently contributes to improving engineering excellence and security across VSaaS and Image Validation. His recent upgrades to key libraries—such as Flask and Connexion—were critical in strengthening the security posture of VSaaS. He also continues to enhance product security by proactively upgrading dependencies within our codebase. Noor completed his required training on time. 
With a key team member, Chris, retiring this year, Noor’s continued focus on minimising knowledge gaps and driving delivery across our workstreams will be essential in the second half of the year. While his mid-year submission was delayed due to vacation, planning ahead for training and compliance-related deadlines will help avoid similar issues going forward. 

Noor’s delivery of the CSI migration for VSaaS ahead of schedule will contribute to significant cost savings, as the decommissioning of legacy CSI resources can now take place earlier than planned. His strong engineering execution throughout the migration has not only reduced infrastructure overhead but also improved the overall quality and maintainability of the platform. This work reflects a high level of technical discipline and contributes directly to long-term efficiency and operational cost reduction.

Noor is an exceptionally talented and technically strong member of the team. He is also a highly collaborative team player, and his positive working style is appreciated by those around him. As part of his continued career progression, Noor is encouraged to regularly showcase his work through demos and presentations—both within the team and on broader platforms. Building strong relationships with stakeholders and partner teams will be key to extending the reach and impact of his contributions. With Chris retiring, this presents a valuable opportunity for Noor to step up, strengthen external engagement, and play a more visible role in driving product excellence for our clients across JPMC.
