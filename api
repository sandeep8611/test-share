Why 2 (Exceeds): Cross-product ownership, cross-sector/vendor coordination, and quantified outcomes beyond assigned scope
Pipelines (3PIIP, UBI, Middleware)
	•	What: Delivered VTM best-practice migration across all pipelines; delivered UBI Micro base image; migrated jobs to Jenkins OSS; ongoing 3PIIP support.
	•	Impact: Success rate 44%→96%; ingestion time 3.55 days→<10 min (small images <3 min); manual VA eliminated; ~2.4k images ingested YTD (1,261 last 90 days, ~170 to prod); UBI Micro: Renovate 92% CVE↓, 68% size↓; K&S ~87.5% Critical/High CVE↓, ~65% size↓.
	•	Interaction: LSE, Jenkins, Middleware, Ops/SRE, Artifactory, App/dev teams, Security/ISOs.
AquaSec
	•	What: Drove federated-registry adoption (3PIIP/UBI/MW) and Aqua console integration to UAT; designed MVP automated testing framework for Aqua components.
	•	Impact: Shared Artifactory load ~55k→~40k calls/day (−20–25%), improving stability/scalability despite overall traffic growth; foundation to reduce manual test effort/errors and speed releases.
	•	Interaction: Aqua (vendor), LSE, Artifactory, OpenShift Eng.
VSaaS
	•	What: Twistlock to Aqua CSI migration; Active-Active HA solution MVP (prod targeted Q4); delivered Chainguard evaluation.
	•	Impact: Seamless migration; DR in place; HA to improve availability/perf; avoided licensing spend, flagged scanning/compatibility risks; defined internal image-hardening path.
	•	Interaction: VSaaS product, AquaSec, Chainguard (vendor), Ops/Networking,
FITR
	•	What: Contributed to FITR library + CS API; enabled container statistics reporting (multiple asks from Jon/Nic); used FITR data to identify/close image-ingress backdoors.
	•	Impact: Insights on base-image hygiene/age; LSE controls added (block dev to prod promotions; prevent unapproved libs); various backdoors closed with Artifactory;
	•	Interaction: AquaSec, DRIFT/Reporting, LSE, Artifactory, Software Supply Chain.


Delivered cross-team outcomes ahead of plan (Q3 → Q2) while in E3 program, and raised the engineering bar—impacting client experience and costs.
VSaaS — CSI Migration
	•	What: Owned migration from legacy Twistlock CSI to Aqua; delivered in Q2 vs planned Q3, while meeting E3 commitments; executed with engineering excellence
	•	Impact: Enabled early retirement of legacy CSI and earlier infra return/decommission, reducing risk and cost; smoother platform experience.
	•	Interaction: VSaaS, Ops/SRE, Networking, AquaSec, Openshift
VSaaS — Major Platform Upgrade (Flask & Connexion)
	•	What: Led upgrade of VSaaS services to Flask + Connexion; engaged Connexion maintainers directly to track/unblock an upstream bug affecting rollout.
	•	Impact: Modernised stack, improved maintainability/perf, unblocked roadmap items; reduced future risk by resolving upstream rather than local workaround.
	•	Interaction: VSaaS Connexion


FITR
	•	What: Stepped up as acting PO when Chris retired; kept roadmap and decisions moving; unblocked team to deliver FITR milestones.
	•	Impact: Maintained delivery velocity and stakeholder alignment; ensured FITR stayed production-ready and useful for DRIFT reporting and downstream integrations.
	•	Interaction: FITR team, Reporting/DRIFT, AquaSec, Security.
UBI 
	•	What: Delivered UBI 9 Minimal (foundation for UBI 9 Micro); demonstrated ownership of the UBI pipeline; guiding base-image owners on correct build approach.
	•	Impact: Standardised modern base images; reduced image size and attack surface, lowering CVE exposure and improving rollout speed across teams.
	•	Interaction: Base-image owner teams, Security/ISOs
3PIIP/Middleware
	•	What: Contributed to migration work and config changes needed for the Enterprise→OSS Jenkins move, Ongoing 3PIIP maintenance/support alongside project delivery. Helped base-image owner teams produce UBI 9 Minimal-based images with the right standards and patterns.
	•	Interaction: App/dev teams, Artifactory, Security/ISOs, Jenkins platform, Middleware
VSaaS
	•	What: Delivered feature such as add Medium-count CVEs to tabular report;
	•	Interaction: VSaaS team,
