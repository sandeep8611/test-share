Thank you for your response and clarification. I understand that I wasn’t marked complete due to partial attendance. However, I’ve been repeatedly asking what needs to be done next — could you please confirm the required steps to resolve this?
Since I couldn’t attend the full training session, I’d appreciate guidance on how to proceed. Should I re-enroll, retake the session, or can this course be removed from my LMS to avoid it remaining indefinitely “In Progress”?
This is my 5th or 6th follow-up on the same issue, and I still haven’t received clear direction. Apologies if I sound persistent, but I really want to close this out properly and follow the right process.
Thank you for your understanding and help in resolving this matter.
