You’re right that OpenShift enforces strong controls (like non-root enforcement), but I was also thinking ahead to other platforms such as EKS or Google Cloud where those same guardrails might not exist by default — or could change in the future. Having EE policies in place would give us a consistent layer of governance across environments, regardless of the platform.
On the tag point — understood about tags being mutable. The idea isn’t to treat the tag itself as immutable, but rather to ensure teams are tagging images in a standardized, traceable way (instead of using latest or no tag at all). That traceability helps us track provenance and align with compliance or audit requirements.
Ultimately, the goal is not to recreate existing OpenShift behavior but to extend EE visibility so we can detect configuration drift, exceptions, or policy gaps across multiple runtime environments.
Thanks again for the feedback — happy to discuss further if it’d be helpful to walk through a few real examples.
