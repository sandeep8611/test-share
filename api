Following up on Noor — he reached out regarding internal mobility. He shared that he’s interested in exploring opportunities across the wider team, including possible roles in the US.
He also mentioned that when Mark was in the office, he discussed this with him. Part of his reasoning is the recent increase in H1B visa fees—he feels an internal move could be a cost-saving option for the company, and since he is currently single, he sees this as a good opportunity to consider relocation if our team needs someone to cover in the US.
I asked if this was driven by any dissatisfaction, and it doesn’t seem so—he said he’s generally happy in the current team and is more in exploration mode at this stage.
Just wanted to keep you updated on the context and his perspective. Please let me know how you’d like me to guide him further.
