Hi Stef,
Thanks for the great questions — let me add a bit more context on each point.
Approved base images: You’re right — currently only JPMC-approved base images can be pulled. However, some developers and teams still build wrappers on top of middleware images or continue using older, insecure images. EE capabilities could help detect and flag cases where non-approved images are attempted or manually sideloaded, allowing us to maintain visibility and enforce compliance more consistently.
Appropriate user: This focuses on validating that containers don’t run as root (unless explicitly justified). The rule would help enforce best practices around container security and least privilege.
Image tags: The idea is to avoid using latest or untagged images. Enforcing versioned tags improves traceability and reproducibility of builds.
These are just a few examples for now. I mainly wanted to get insights into your team’s current roadmap and an idea of the timeframe if we were to start implementing such rules.
As mentioned before, we’d love to extend our EE capabilities for containers and avoid building a separate tool since we already have this great platform. We’re happy to collaborate or support in any way to help prioritize or implement these enhancements.
