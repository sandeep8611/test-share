Throughout this year, I have demonstrated a commitment to JP's leadership principles by taking ownership of high-impact initiatives, delivering quality results with pride, and fostering a collaborative environment. My efforts have contributed to key projects that drive engineering excellence, enhance cybersecurity, and improve operational efficiency, while also supporting the growth and development of my colleagues.


"We Take Ownership" I took ownership of stalled and high-risk projects, such as the 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP), Middleware pipeline, UBI Pipeline, and the VSaaS, which were essential to JP's strategy. I approached them with a problem-solving mindset, embracing challenges and driving them to completion despite tight deadlines, significant technical challenges, and required complex coordination across multiple teams. When 3PIIP had been delayed for years, I revitalized the project by engaging key stakeholders across ICG, CTO, CTI, and Cyber teams to align on requirements. I rebranded the initiative as 3PIIP, launched a strategic communication plan, and transitioned more than 30 teams, including flagship applications such as Crowdstrike, Qualys, Postgres, and Spark, to the new automated system between August and September.
With the decommissioning of Twistlock, I took ownership of developing and executing a comprehensive roadmap to transition all container security services (VSaaS, 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware Pipelines) to Aqua. I led every aspect of this transition, including stakeholder engagement across ICG and CTO sectors, migration planning, and resolving technical blockers, ensuring a seamless shift without disrupting production. My efforts included creating a detailed strategy to migrate users, collaborating with teams across sectors, and managing dependencies and integration with critical systems such as LightSpeed and Artifactory.

"We Deliver With Pride" I consistently delivered high-quality results by simplifying processes, implementing sustainable solutions, and upholding JP's standards of operational excellence. In leading the transition from Twistlock to Aqua, I achieved a 75% reduction in scan times and improved failure rates from 3% to just 0.2%, driving significant enhancements in efficiency and developer productivity. Over the past 10 months, VSaaS scaled from 20,000 image scans per month in December 2023 to over 80,000 scans today, with a projected 100,000 scans by year-end.
For the 3PIIP and UBI pipelines, I addressed root causes, user challenges, and blockers that had stalled progress. By conducting user interviews and analysing feedback, I introduced enhancements that resulted in an 80% decrease in error rates.  The automation of the pipeline reduced image ingestion times from over a month to a single day, while new user capabilities expanded the adoption of the pipeline across multiple teams and sectors. Additionally, I partnered with Artifactory team in decommissioning outdated manual process and migrated teams to a secure, automated workflow, resulting in long-term value through cost savings, risk reduction, and improved developer experiences.. I also ensured the availability of RHEL 8 and 9 images for UBI, with scans completed within a day of release, by decommissioning the legacy RHEL 7 infrastructure.

"We Succeed Together" I fostered a collaborative culture, breaking down silos to deliver optimal results for JP. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including Artifactory, VA, Cyber, and LightSpeed, to ensure seamless migrations and coordinated testing of Aqua with critical services. 
My leadership in guiding the cross-functional workstreams to transition the Middleware pipeline to Aqua ensured that we met the Twistlock decommissioning deadline, avoiding potential security risks. With no clear ownership for the Middleware pipeline migration, I stepped forward to lead the transformation by aligning multiple stakeholders across CTI, Cyber, ICG, Artifactory, and Operations to ensure success. 
I partnered with the ICG LightSpeed and Artifactory teams to migrate over 700 CSI applications that leveraged VSaaS for image scanning from Twistlock to Aqua, resulting in more than 80,000 scans per month with improved accuracy and fewer false positives.

In my efforts to automate the release process for VSaaS, I spearheaded a cross-functional initiative to integrate Release-on-Demand (RoD) with the Project Tracking System (PTS), significantly reducing manual efforts and enabling faster, audit-compliant releases. Previously, production releases took up to a week due to manual tasks in change ticket creation and audit submission. By automating the PTS compliance and audit process, I reduced release times from a week to just one day. This initiative laid the foundation for expanding RoD capabilities across other sectors, further promoting operational efficiency within the firm.
Investing in the growth of my colleagues and teams has been a top priority. This year, I expanded my role to include four matrix reports (1 SVP, 2 VPs, and a 2nd-year graduate). As their matrix manager, I take full responsibility for their professional development, performance, and compliance adherence. I conduct regular one-on-one meetings, create career development plans, and ensure all mandatory training is completed. I also take the lead in talent acquisition for critical roles, successfully interviewing and hiring for two VP positions and conducting interviews for a new Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team to ensure operational excellence for container security products and other infrastructure.
As a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the Engineering Excellence Program in CISO, I have played a key role in helping teams modernise their applications and adopt best practices. I have delivered multiple demos and workshops, attended by over 200 members, upskilling teams across the firm. Additionally, I authored articles and published videos on topics such as test automation, container best practices, version control, and CI/CD pipelines. These resources, featured on JP's Techfest channel, serve as a knowledge hub for the organization, with one of my video tutorials becoming one of the top most-watched.
I also actively contributed to the EO&T Global Mentoring Program, mentoring team members and guiding them in career advancement and personal growth. Through my involvement with the Caliber Global Leadership Accelerator Program and the EO&T Diversity Operating Committee, I have supported leadership development initiatives and talent diversity, promoting inclusion within the organization.
