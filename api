Hi Team,
I’d like to nominate myself as Tooling Champion for a few key areas that I’ve been actively driving and contributing to:
1. Containers Development
I’ve been deeply involved in container development—covering the end-to-end lifecycle of building, optimizing, and managing containers. Beyond day-to-day engineering, I’ve also authored “5 Tricks to Slim Your Containers”, sharing practical guidance to help teams build leaner, more efficient container images.
2. Container Security
Security is core to container adoption at scale. I currently lead VSaaS (Vulnerability Scanning as a Service), which is fully integrated with our CI system. It provides developers with shift-left, actionable vulnerability reports for container images—helping teams catch and remediate issues earlier, reduce risk, and maintain compliance.
3. 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP)
I also drive the 3rd Party Image Ingestion Pipeline (3PIIP) initiative, which securely enables ingestion of container images from external registries into our internal Artifactory. This self-service platform ensures that all imported images undergo vulnerability scanning and essential compliance checks—offering developers a streamlined and secure way to promote images for use in their applications.
I’m passionate about helping our engineering teams adopt, scale, and get the most value out of these tools and frameworks. As Tooling Champion, I’ll continue to:
Share best practices and learning resources.
Provide guidance on effective usage.
Ensure smooth adoption and integration across teams.
