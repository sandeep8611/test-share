Project: FITR (Image Ancestry Tracking)
Meeting Type: Design Discussion
Date: [Insert Date]
Attendees: [Insert Names of Attendees]
Facilitator: [Insert Name if applicable]

Discussion Points & Action Items
Toggle Feature for Production Control
Discussion: It was agreed that the system design should incorporate a toggle feature to easily enable or disable FITR in production without requiring redeployment.
Action: Design to include a configuration-based toggle mechanism.
Incremental Release Strategy
Discussion: Explored the feasibility of gradual rollout vs. a big bang release. A Blue/Green deployment approach was proposed to test internally before full release.
Action: Evaluate and finalize Blue/Green deployment strategy to support phased rollout.
Caching Strategy
Discussion: Consideration of long-term caching methods. Two approaches discussed:
Pruning old/unused cache entries selectively.
Flushing all cache, though this could impact FITR performance.
Decision: Leaning toward pruning for better performance and scalability.
Action: Design team to explore efficient pruning mechanisms for cache management.
Handling of Existing base_image Field
Discussion: For backward compatibility, the current base_image field will be retained temporarily with a constant value mapping to the new schema field.
Action:
Update design to reflect this interim mapping strategy.
Haroon to investigate if the field is actively used.
If unused, proceed with removal in a future cleanup.
