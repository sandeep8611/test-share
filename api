However, I’m still seeing a few references that need adjustment:
Other images are still using the latest tag. Could you please update them with explicit version tags so developers can reference a fixed version instead of latest?
I also noticed references to RHEL UBI 7, which is now end-of-life. These should be updated to supported versions.
There’s a page for base images where all the latest tags are listed. I’d recommend updating those references with explicit tags as well.
Can you make these changes too, please?
