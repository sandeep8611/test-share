Noor, this workstream requires coordinated delivery between the Gating team and the CI/CD team. I’m aligning on responsibilities and dependencies before committing to any timelines, as I don’t want to set incorrect expectations given the cross-team involvement.
Haroon and I have a working session with the Gating team tomorrow to review the schema updates for the new endpoint that will expose gating results. We’ll also clarify lower-environment testing options and the CI/CD integration approach.
Let me regroup after tomorrow’s discussion, and I’ll come back with a more concrete estimate and a high-level roadmap.
