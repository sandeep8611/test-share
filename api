Separately, Romeo has set up a meeting with the OpenShift Operator pipeline team to discuss potentially moving them into 3PiiP. This appears non-trivial, given their current model (direct ingestion of large volumes of images into Artifactory) versus 3PiiP’s scan-and-gate-before-ingest approach. I’ll gather more details tomorrow to better understand the use case and feasibility.
At this point, both items lack clear scope and sizing, so it’s difficult to responsibly add migration or re-platforming work into the roadmap without deprioritizing existing commitments. I’ll follow up with more clarity once I have additional information.
