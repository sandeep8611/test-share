1. You need to make yourself up and always available for new challenges/works from Nic and Jon…to do this… you need to delegate all things…
       Few things you mightn’t be able to delegate (performance review submit) but all other things you can delegate…
       Eg. Even chasing for voice of employee, chasing trainings, approval CMPs… chasing tasks…you just need 1 or 2 team members you can trust so you can delegate…
          you don’t need to show Nic that you are chasing but you have a team smoothly running and you are available for new challenges…
2. Structure your team… 
    tell them what information you need from them weekly basis (eg.) what format… and you revise - so you don’t chase them with unscheduled meetings…
   Also make someone like PO …for all admin stuff…. so team can reach out to them and you get free time… (compare with Gary idea this is different…)
