Not entirely sure what specific use case you're referring to under "AI tools for Automation Testing"â€”are you looking for test case generation, test execution, coverage analysis, or something else?

That said, here are some tools we currently have access to or use:

ðŸ¤– GitHub Co-pilot in JPMC â€“ useful for code completion and generating test code snippets.
âœ… Sqood â€“ used for automated code reviews; it can suggest changes within a single PR or across entire repositories, which helps improve code quality and testability.
If youâ€™re thinking about a particular stage in the testing lifecycle (e.g., test generation, validation, or CI optimization), happy to dive deeper or explore options with you.
