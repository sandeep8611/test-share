Noor consistently contributes to improving engineering excellence and security across VSaaS and Image Validation. His recent upgrades to key libraries—such as Flask and Connexion—were critical in strengthening the security posture of VSaaS. He also continues to enhance product security by proactively upgrading dependencies within our codebase. Noor completed his required training on time. 
With a key team member, Chris, retiring this year, Noor’s continued focus on minimising knowledge gaps and driving delivery across our workstreams will be essential in the second half of the year. While his mid-year submission was delayed due to vacation, planning ahead for training and compliance-related deadlines will help avoid similar issues going forward. 

Noor’s delivery of the CSI migration for VSaaS ahead of schedule will contribute to significant cost savings, as the decommissioning of legacy CSI resources can now take place earlier than planned. His strong engineering execution throughout the migration has not only reduced infrastructure overhead but also improved the overall quality and maintainability of the platform. This work reflects a high level of technical discipline and contributes directly to long-term efficiency and operational cost reduction.

Noor is an exceptionally talented and technically strong member of the team. He is also a highly collaborative team player, and his positive working style is appreciated by those around him. As part of his continued career progression, Noor is encouraged to regularly showcase his work through demos and presentations—both within the team and on broader platforms. Building strong relationships with stakeholders and partner teams will be key to extending the reach and impact of his contributions. With Chris retiring, this presents a valuable opportunity for Noor to step up, strengthen external engagement, and play a more visible role in driving product excellence for our clients across JPMC.


Haroon has stepped up to take on temporary Product Owner responsibilities for the FITR project, demonstrating strong ownership and a willingness to expand his leadership portfolio. He has been effectively guiding the team, keeping sprint focus aligned, and ensuring the workstream progresses toward its objectives. Alongside FITR, Haroon has continued to ensure the stability of critical container security services, such as the 3PIIP pipeline, supporting operational continuity for our users. As a senior member of the team—especially following the departure of senior members like Chris—Haroon is expected to continue growing his impact, driving delivery against our quarterly commitments, and helping to minimise the gap left by that transition. His accountability, ownership, and contributions beyond his core areas will position him well to broaden his portfolio and make an even greater impact in the second half of the year.

Haroon proactively raised potential risks related to the Enterprise Jenkins to Open Source Jenkins migration and is actively working to ensure pipeline stability throughout the transition, minimising impact to users. He also completed all required training on time. However, there was a breach of the firm’s Personal Trading and Investment Policy, and Haroon is expected to fully comply with this and all other firm policies going forward. Continued adherence to compliance expectations, along with Haroon’s demonstrated risk awareness in his engineering responsibilities, will be essential to maintaining consistency and accountability in the second half of the year.

Continued adherence to compliance expectations, alongside his demonstrated risk awareness in engineering responsibilities, will be essential to maintaining consistency and accountability.

Haroon contributed to the integration of VTM Best Practice rules into our pipelines, helping to automate the previously manual Vulnerability Assessment (VA) review process. This work is expected to significantly improve efficiency by reducing reliance on manual reviews and providing faster, more consistent feedback to our users.


Haroon successfully delivered the UBI 9 Minimal hardened image for our users, providing a lightweight and secure base that helps reduce the overall attack surface. He also continues to support users of the 3PIIP pipelines. As a senior member of the team, Haroon is encouraged to further expand his visibility and stakeholder engagement. For example, proactively sharing product updates through demos or presentations with wider JPMC teams would not only increase awareness of our services but also help strengthen his cross-team relationships and professional network.



Romeo has performed well in the first half of the year, growing into his role and expanding his contributions beyond pipeline work into key areas of our container security products, including Aqua and FITR. He has demonstrated strong ownership of his workstreams and delivered without compromising on quality. Notable examples include his ongoing work on UBI 9 Micro and the integration of the Artifactory federated repository with AquaSec. In addition, he has taken on a mentorship role with our junior team member, Oyin, and built strong working relationships with members of the Aqua team, contributing to a culture of shared ownership. In the second half of the year, continuing to lead delivery and expanding his portfolio across core container security projects will be especially important as we transition through the departure of a key senior team member, Chris. Romeo’s continued growth in delivery and ownership will be critical to minimising risk and sustaining momentum across the team.


Romeo has proactively identified and addressed potential risks arising from unexpected platform changes, including the Artifactory Federated Repository migration and the CloudBees Enterprise Jenkins transition to open source. In both cases, he played a key role by taking shared ownership with the team to ensure continuity and minimise disruption to our container security products. For the Artifactory federated repository integration, he led the end-to-end effort with the Aqua team—completing integration, testing across environments, and preparing for production deployment.
In addition, Romeo made a significant contribution to strengthening the security posture of our third-party container image pipeline. He conducted a thorough investigation into potential backdoors for image ingestion and promotion, documented his findings, and initiated remediation discussions with relevant stakeholders. This work resulted in additional controls being implemented in the LSE platform, including blocking unapproved image promotions from dev environments during production builds.
Romeo also completed all mandatory training on time.


Romeo contributed to the integration of VTM Best Practice rules into our pipelines, helping to automate the previously manual Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process. This work has significantly improved efficiency by reducing reliance on manual reviews and enabling faster, more consistent feedback to users. As a result, the 3PIIP pipeline success rate improved from approximately 44% to 96%, and image ingestion times were reduced substantially. Romeo also provided support to Noor during the CSI migration for VSaaS, which was delivered well ahead of the original schedule. In addition, his contributions to engineering excellence—such as developing an automated testing framework for Aqua and onboarding tools like Renovate and Squad—have played a key role in improving the quality and maintainability of our services. Continuing to drive improvements in these areas will be critical to the team's success in the second half of the year.

Romeo plays an important role in both developing features for our pipeline services and providing critical support to our users. He supports user queries and ensures they receive the right guidance for onboarding and effective use of our pipelines. His contribution to the migration of our pipelines to the Artifactory federated instance demonstrates his ownership mindset and willingness to engage beyond his core responsibilities—including gaining an understanding of Aqua and supporting its migration. Romeo’s ongoing support for our users and involvement in areas beyond pipelines will help broaden his impact and further strengthen relationships with our clients and stakeholders.
