"Thanks for sharing â€” it's clear the shift toward security-left is accelerating with platforms like Minimus and Chainguard. Compared to that, the base images we currently produce via Middle team are significantly heavier and harder to secure. There's a real opportunity here to modernize our approach."

Would be great to explore a pilot or POC to see how a switch could improve our CVE profile and developer experience.
