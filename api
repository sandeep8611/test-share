We discussed supporting SHA-based ingestion in the 3PiiP pipeline and created the corresponding stories. The work is currently in our backlog; however, we have not been able to make progress due to higher-priority items that required immediate attention.
Once capacity opens up, I will review the scope and come back with a clear execution plan and timeline for progressing this work.
Please let me know if you'd like me to reprioritize it relative to current commitments.
