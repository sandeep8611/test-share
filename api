Hi Mike & Stef — since we rolled out UBI Minimal/Micro bases in JPMC, I’m collecting success stories + hard numbers to share with senior leadership and for demos.
Could you share a quick before → after for a Lightspeed (Tekton) step where you tried UBI Minimal/Micro? Even rough numbers help.
What to share (before → after)
Image size (MB) & layer count
CVE counts (Critical/High/Medium)
Package count
Build performance (step pull time, total pipeline p50)
Runtime impact (start-up latency, RSS/CPU)
Network/storage (pull/push MB, registry egress, workspace artifact size)
Anything else you noticed (e.g., simpler patching, fewer re-approvals)
If it’s easier, just paste logs/artifacts and I’ll extract the numbers. Thanks so much!
