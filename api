Noor, as mentioned over chat, I am summarising the recent meeting with the OpenShift Operator Pipeline team and the subsequent follow-up actions I performed.
Context and Meeting Objective The meeting included myself, Romeo, Haroon, and members of the OpenShift Operator Pipeline team. The objective was to understand their current image ingestion pipeline, discuss their challenges with adopting 3PiiP for external image ingestion, and reiterate our previously aligned position that supporting the OpenShift Operator team is not part of our roadmap. The expectation is that they will need to drive their onboarding into 3PiiP, as the current VSaaS-based approach they are using is not an official or supported long-term solution.
At the start of the meeting, Romeo explained that we wanted to understand their existing pipeline. I further clarified that while we were open to understanding their flow and constraints, we would not continue supporting or enhancing the existing VSaaS-based process, and that the long-term strategy remains a transition to 3PiiP.
Meeting Dynamics During the discussion, the OpenShift team pushed back, stating that we could not simply stop supporting the existing process since they are already using it. During this exchange, Romeo became visibly frustrated and stated, in an emotional manner to myself and Haroon, that this was not the agreed agenda for the meeting. To allow the meeting to continue productively, I asked Romeo to lead the remainder of the discussion. This occurred in front of the OpenShift team and gave the impression that our team was not fully aligned in how we were positioning the message.
Follow-up Action After the meeting, I had a separate 1:I explained that, as a team, it is important that we present a consistent message in cross-team meetings. I emphasised that if there is disagreement, whether with another team member or even with me that it should be handled calmly and not debated emotionally in front of external stakeholders. I advised that such concerns should be addressed either diplomatically during the meeting or followed up offline so we can align internally before engaging further. 1 also emphasise that he continues to be a strong contributor and works very well within the team and focused on the importance of maintaining a consistent and calm team presence in cross-team forums.
I reinforced the expectation that, as a team, we should present a unified message and demonstrate strong team spirit in front of other organizations, and that any misalignment can be addressed offline so we remain effective and aligned during joint discussions.
The intent of this follow-up was to reinforce expectations around professionalism, alignment, and effective communication, particularly in potentially contentious cross-org conversations.
Please let me know if you would like any additional detail or if there are any further actions you would like me to take.
