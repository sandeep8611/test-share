SRE Engagement Summary (VSaaS and Other Services)
Scope of SRE involvement:
SRE team is currently engaged only with VSaaS.
They are not yet involved in 3PIIP, UBI, or MW pipeline services.
Current contributions and progress (VSaaS):
The team reviewed our existing monitoring setup and helped migrate dashboards into Grafana, improving visibility and maintainability.
They’ve been very supportive for dashboard-related activities and general SRE tasks.
Configured Netcool alert notifications for VSaaS failures — a key improvement in operational monitoring.
While they don’t provide direct support for VSaaS incidents, they are available for any SRE-related guidance or implementation, which helps reduce dependency on our engineering resources.
Impact and improvements:
Improved observability and alerting setup for VSaaS.
Reduced engineering load on our side for SRE-type work.
Faster identification of failures through integrated alerting and dashboarding.
Areas not yet covered:
No active SRE support for pipelines (3PIIP, UBI, MW).
No end-to-end incident management or client support ownership by SRE yet.
Next steps / future outlook:
The biggest value add going forward would be for SRE to take full operational ownership of VSaaS, including:
Handling VSaaS failure events end-to-end.
Providing client-facing support for incidents and queries.
This would free up our engineers to focus entirely on product development and improvements.
