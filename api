Hi,
I wanted to do a quick check-in to see whether you have had a chance to speak with the Ansible team regarding their approach to bringing a Jenkins controller into their own space.
If possible, I would like to discuss their experience to better understand the relative size and complexity of this effort, including considerations around ongoing maintenance, operational support, and associated risk/CAPs. This would help us assess feasibility and inform our internal planning.
Please let me know if this has already been discussed, or if you would prefer to connect over Zoom to review.
Thanks,
