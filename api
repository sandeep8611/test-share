The VSaaS tabular report now includes a breakdown of medium severities in both the application and base layers, similar to the existing critical and high severity reporting. VSaaS has also been upgraded to use the latest Vault image for secret injection, improving security, reliability, and compatibility with updated Vault features. In addition, failover capabilities are being set up and tested in the DEV environment to ensure higher availability and resilience. The Python base image has been updated to the latest version, along with all package dependencies. These enhancements are already available in UAT and are scheduled for production release in the coming days.
