Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you are well.

I am writing to request clarification regarding my pension contributions and the annual allowance limit. I recall speaking with you over the phone last year, during which you mentioned that if my contributions exceed the annual allowance, I would be notified, and that any unused allowance from the previous three years would be automatically applied where applicable.

As I review my contributions for this year, I am concerned that I may be approaching or exceeding the annual limit, and I want to ensure I avoid any unexpected tax charges.

Could you please help me understand the following:

How can I track my current pension contributions against the annual allowance?
Will I be notified if I exceed the limit, and if so, how and when?
Is the carry-forward of unused allowance from the past three years applied automatically, or do I need to take any action?
Is there anything I should do now to ensure I remain within the allowable limits?
I appreciate your guidance on this and look forward to your response
