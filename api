Title:
Investigate Discrepancy Between Console and Report Container Counts in aqua-statistic

Description:
Manager reported that the console is showing 98k running containers, while the generated report shows 52k. This inconsistency suggests a potential issue in the aqua-statistic code/script responsible for generating these numbers.

Steps/Details:

Console output: 98,000 running containers
Report output: 52,000 running containers
Code module involved: aqua-statistic
Potential area of investigation: container counting logic, data source mismatch, filtering conditions.
Expected Outcome:

Root cause identified and fixed.
Report and console should reflect consistent container counts.
