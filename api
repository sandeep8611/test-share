This month, we updated the VSaaS Dockerfile to use the Federated Artifactory instance for improved scalability and performance, and enhanced error messaging by including the input image name when unsupported images are detected. On the security and improvements side, we migrated the test_2005_end_to_end_multi_arch_image integration test to the latest CSI 177, upgraded the base image and codebase to the latest Python version, and refreshed all Vigas packages to their most recent releases for stability and security. Additionally, we adopted the latest Vault image for secret injection and configured VSaaS as an active-active service across two OpenShift clusters, with preparations underway to test failover capabilities in production to address the current dependency on a single Aqua Server.
