Hi Shekar,
Haroon has been following up for several weeks now regarding the Python RHEL 9 base image delivery and Miniconda image optimization, but there has been no update or sharing of progress from your end.
As you are aware, Haroon has already stepped in to help on this activity — which is an additional responsibility for him — yet he has not been receiving the necessary support.
Currently, the Miniconda UBI8/UBI9 images are not meeting expectations. They significantly exceed the intended size and thus defeat the purpose of using UBI9-minimal as a base image. It’s important that we address this before any release of the Red Hat Python UBI9 base image, as releasing with the current approach would undermine our optimization goals.
Could you please:
Work with Harpal to review and fix the Miniconda image build approach (including the multi-stage Dockerfile optimization shared by Haroon), and
Provide a clear status update on the delivery of the Red Hat Python UBI9 base image by the end of this week.
