Rimas has performed well this year, settling into his role and contributing not only to pipeline development but also to broader areas of our container security products. He has demonstrated strong initiative by stepping outside his comfort zone to support projects such as VSaaS and AquaSec. He also showed effective leadership through his collaboration with the Middleware team to improve base images across all languages and by driving delivery of the UBI 9 Micro initiative. Additionally, he has played an important role in ensuring the stability of critical container security services, including the 3PiiP pipeline, helping maintain operational continuity for our users. Rimas has also taken on mentoring responsibilities with Oyin, involving him in meaningful work on the 3PiiP pipeline.
This year, Rimas also began contributing to the new FITR feeds reporting, which now provides daily insights that support the firm’s container base image uplift strategy. His work on this reporting stream is already adding significant value for senior leaders, helping identify outdated or vulnerable base images and driving uplift efforts that materially strengthen the firm’s container security posture.
As he continues to grow, I encourage Rimas to further strengthen his engagement with internal team members and key stakeholders. Developing stronger cross-team relationships, proactively shaping workstreams, and taking broader ownership of end-to-end delivery will be important steps as he progresses toward SVP-level expectations. To operate effectively at that level, expanding his accountability beyond immediate tasks, influencing direction across interconnected workstreams, and demonstrating greater visibility through regular updates, demos, and stakeholder communication will be key.
Finally, it is important for Rimas to maintain consistent attention to compliance obligations. A recent escalated reminder regarding his pending compliance statement indicates an area for improvement. Ensuring timely completion of all compliance requirements will be essential as he takes on greater leadership responsibility.


Haroon stepped into the Product Owner role for the FITR project mid-year after Chris’s retirement and successfully guided it to production. He also demonstrated strong ownership through the delivery of the UBI 9 Minimal initiative and has ensured the stability of critical container security services—including the 3PiiP pipeline—supporting ongoing operational continuity for our users.
This year, Haroon began taking ownership of the intermediate image uplift work, partnering closely with the MW team to upgrade their base images to UBI 9 (Minimal/Micro). This initiative is already delivering value and presents a significant opportunity for him next year to demonstrate end-to-end ownership, deepen cross-team collaboration, and further increase his visibility with key stakeholders.
As he continues to grow into his role as SVP, I expect Haroon to take full ownership of his workstreams and proactively lead them by ensuring roadmaps and JIRA items are well defined. I would also like to see him engage more closely with teams such as Aqua and other key stakeholders, mentor and guide team members, and elevate the visibility of our work through client demos and presentations. Taking broader accountability—such as identifying high-priority workstreams, contributing to overall team objectives, and supporting delivery across the team—will further strengthen his leadership impact. Expanding his ownership beyond core areas will position him well to broaden his portfolio and grow as a senior leader.
