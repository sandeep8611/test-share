Agreed. I also think it makes more sense to identify an orchestration layer that fits 3PiiP’s needs, while continuing to use Jenkins underneath, rather than adopting or waiting on a new end-to-end solution that may not align with our use cases.
I’ll dig into this further tomorrow and brainstorm options with the team, then come back with recommendations.
