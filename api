Just to clarify — there is no such concept as “images being PROD instances.” Images themselves are not instances; they are simply artifacts. The concern here is only around where those images are stored and how the SealID is being used.
As Romeo mentioned, the images were only built and pushed but never deployed or run in any PROD environment. We can remove the LSE projects if that helps avoid confusion and alerts going forward.
