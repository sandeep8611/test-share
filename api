I improved client outcomes by partnering across platform, engineering, and security teams to make secure-by-default the easiest path for application owners. VSaaS now scans 180k+ images/month at ~99.5% success rate, while 3PIIP has ingested ~2,400 new third-party images YTD into JPMC. I led hardened RHEL 9 Minimal (Q1) and Micro (Q3) bases with auto-updates aligned to Red Hat’s cadence (≈7–14 days) and low-to-zero critical CVEs; refreshed Helix/Tekton blueprints for Python/Java with LSE/Helix; and blocked RHEL 7 usage—cutting toil and accelerating safe delivery. In VSaaS, I enabled multi-architecture operator scanning (6k+ images/month), integrated FITR lineage and Image Assurance Policies (malware, sensitive data, age, superuser) into reports, and designed Aqua console failover for higher availability. I also moved container security products to GitHub Enterprise, Gen-AI (JPMC Squad) code review, Copilot, and Release-on-Demand, lifting developer experience and throughput. Finally, I led a rigorous Chainguard evaluation that surfaced scanner gaps and informed a “strengthen our approved middleware base images” decision—doing what’s best for developers and the JPMC.
Outcomes / Achievements
	•	Faster, safer starts: RHEL 9 Minimal & Micro in production with an auto-update process; partnered with Renovate and LSE to adopt UBI Minimal/Micro, driving near-zero critical/high CVEs. Updated UBI base-image pages with curated tags/variants and published “Slim containers” patterns (e.g., Java ~190 MB via jlink with zero critical CVEs).
	•	Lower developer toil: Right base + current patches saves ~5 hours/engineer/month on CVE remediation and reduces escalations from app teams.
	•	Shift-left clarity: VSaaS reports show FITR layer breakdown, base-image age, and Image Assurance Policies (malware, sensitive data, images > 2 years, superuser) for earlier, actionable decisions.
	•	Operator ecosystem enabled: Added multi-arch scanning in VSaaS for OpenShift’s 3rd-party operator pipeline; ~6k+ operator images scanned monthly.
	•	Resilience for clients: Designed VSaaS to survive Aqua console outages (multi-console failover), improving service continuity.
	•	Engineering excellence at scale:
	◦	Developer Manifesto (CSI 177207): Responsible Admin 60%, Auto-decline PRs 70%, Auto-delete branches 84%, check-in .gitignore 46%.
	◦	Copilot access: 75% of developers enabled.
	◦	Repo/pipeline migration: 51% to GitHub; 67 RoD deployments; capabilities metric 52% → 77% (25% improvement).
	•	Platform stability & efficiency: Completed 100% migration of container-security products to Federated Artifactory, targeting –80% incidents while maintaining/improving performance and reducing scanning-disruption risk. Reduced load on the main (shared) Artifactory by ~20–25% (reduced average calls ~55k → ~40k), materially improving stability and headroom despite overall traffic growth from containerisation effort.
	•	Chainguard evaluation: POC completed; identified Aqua scanner coverage gaps and operational friction; recommendation accepted not to proceed and to harden JPMC-approved bases and guidance.
	•	Base-image improvements across JPMC: Partnered with middleware owners to replace “latest” with pinned tags and add Renovate automation; expanded pages for UBI Standard/Minimal/Micro to help teams choose correctly from the start.
	•	Release efficiency: Migrated AquaSec to RoD—automating releases and reducing cycle time from days → hours.
