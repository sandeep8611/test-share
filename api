This year, I made significant contributions to JP’s financial performance by driving key initiatives that improved operational efficiency, reduced costs, and strengthened cybersecurity capabilities. By leading high-impact projects such as the VSaaS/Aqua migration, 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware pipeline transitions, and Grafeas decommissioning, I delivered over $10 million in projected savings while ensuring continued operational stability and enhanced developer productivity. My leadership extended to key talent acquisition within the CISO organisation, ensuring our teams are equipped to support long-term growth and operational resilience.

VSaaS/Aqua Migration - $10 Million Savings Over 3 Years
This year, I successfully led the migration of the VSaaS API from Twistlock to Aqua, resulting in substantial operational efficiencies and cost savings. This migration has increased reliability and scalability, contributing to a projected $10 million in savings over the next three years. Key accomplishments include:
	•	Operational Efficiency & Risk Management: Reduced failure rates from 3% with Twistlock to 0.2% with Aqua, significantly enhancing vulnerability scanning and strengthening JP’s cybersecurity posture.
	•	Productivity Gains: Reduced scan times by over 75%, from 173 seconds to just 42 seconds, greatly improving developer productivity and shortening feedback loops.
	•	Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partnered with CIB, CTO, and Cyber teams to ensure seamless integration of CI Tekton pipelines with VSaaS Aqua, scanning 100% of internal container images for vulnerabilities.
	•	Scalability & Efficiency: With 80,000 scans per month via Aqua, the migration has provided higher-quality scan results and fewer false positives compared to Twistlock, leading to better accuracy and improved developer experience.
	•	Developer Productivity & Risk Mitigation: Addressed performance bottlenecks in the Tekton build pipeline, ensuring 90% of scans now complete within the build process, improving real-time vulnerability reporting and saving multi-minutes on release builds.
This migration supports JP's long-term financial and security goals by driving productivity, mitigating security risks, and significantly improving the efficiency of the development cycle.

3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware Pipelines Transition to Aqua
In addition to the VSaaS migration, I led the transition of the 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware pipelines from Twistlock to Aqua, enhancing security and delivering long-term cost savings:
	•	Operational Efficiency & Risk Management: Completed the transition to Aqua for all backend scanning across 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware pipelines, improving vulnerability assessment accuracy and strengthening cybersecurity.
	•	Leadership & Cross-Functional Collaboration: Overcame multiple technical blockers and collaborated with CTI, CTO, and operations teams to transition the Middleware pipeline ahead of Twistlock’s decommissioning, preventing security risks.
	•	Enhanced UBI Pipeline: Upgraded UBI to support the latest RHEL 8 and 9 versions, resolving critical blockers and ensuring compatibility with updated security standards.
	•	Decommissioning of RHEL 7: Successfully decommissioned legacy RHEL 7 infrastructure, reducing costs and freeing resources for strategic priorities.
	•	Decommissioned Twistlock: This migration is projected to save $10 million over the next three years, reflecting my focus on cost efficiency and improved security.
By leading this complex transition, I ensured that the decommissioning of Twistlock did not disrupt critical processes, protecting the firm from potential security risks and contributing to the organisation’s broader financial and cybersecurity goals.

Grafeas Decommissioning and Migration to Aqua
I successfully led the migration from Grafeas to Aqua for storing custom severity data, integrating this process across key security products such as VSaaS, 3PIIP, UBI, and Middleware pipelines. Key achievements include:
	•	Seamless Migration: Designed and implemented a Grafeas-replacement library, modernising CVE Review Automation and Image Validation scripts, and ensuring full integration with Aqua.
	•	Operational Efficiency & Cost Savings: Decommissioning Grafeas and its infrastructure will save JP at least $10,000 annually, showcasing my ability to optimize resources and streamline processes.
	•	Enhanced Security: This migration strengthened our cybersecurity posture by ensuring custom severity solutions are fully integrated with Aqua’s platform, offering improved reliability and pipeline integration.
This migration highlights my focus on driving long-term operational efficiencies while aligning with the firm’s goals of security, engineering excellence, and cost optimisation.

Interviewing and Hiring for Key Roles in the CISO Organization
This year, I played a pivotal role in talent acquisition for the CISO organisation, helping secure key roles that support the development and security of essential pipelines and infrastructure services. Key achievements include:
	•	VP - Pipeline Team (3PIIP): I interviewed and onboarded a Vice President for the 3PIIP team, filling a role critical to the production availability of 3PIIP after four years of delays.
	•	VP - Aqua Team: I secured a VP for the Aqua team, focusing on candidates with expertise in container security. Securing this talent was essential to maintain progress after the loss of two key team members.
	•	Building the New SRE Team: I am conducting interviews to build a new Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. This team will provide reliability and operational excellence for container security products and Vault, preventing outages and improving scalability.
Through my leadership in talent acquisition, I ensured the CISO organisation is equipped with the expertise needed to meet operational needs while supporting long-term goals of security, reliability, and cost optimisation.
