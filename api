Goal: Integrate Malware Scanning and Enforce Image Blocking Controls
By the end of Q2 2026, integrate the new Malware Scanning Service with 3PiiP and UBI pipelines and implement automated blocking of non-compliant container images, supported by a formally documented and approved exception governance process.

Goal: Strengthen VTM Image Security Policy and Enforcement
By the end of Q1 2026, enhance the VTM image security policy to increase the enforcement threshold beyond GEMs and exploitable CVEs, obtain formal approval from Nic and relevant JPMC security stakeholders, and implement the updated policy within production pipelines.

Client & Franchise Outcomes
Goal: Enhance 3PiiP for Digest-Based Image Ingestion and Third-Party Operator Support
By the end of Q2 2026, enhance 3PiiP to support digest-based image ingestion and enable onboarding of approved third-party operators, delivering production-ready implementation with updated validation logic and documented integration standards.


Goal: Scale and Harden VSaaS for Projected Workload Growth
By the end of Q2 2026, design, implement, and validate scalability and resiliency enhancements for VSaaS to support projected container build growth, ensuring stable production performance under defined peak load conditions.

Measurable Success Criteria:
	•	Capacity assessment and projected growth model documented by Q1
	•	Load testing completed simulating at least 2x current peak workload
	•	Auto-scaling or capacity scaling mechanisms implemented
	•	No production incidents attributable to capacity constraints post-implementation
	•	Performance SLAs maintained under stress-test conditions

Goal: Optimise VSaaS Scalability to Support Growth While Controlling Infrastructure Costs
By the end of Q2 2026, implement and validate scalability enhancements for VSaaS to support projected container build growth while optimising infrastructure utilisation, ensuring the platform sustains at least 2x current peak workload.
	•	Capacity assessment and projected growth model documented by Q1
	•	Support ≥2x current peak load
	•	Auto-scaling or capacity scaling mechanisms implemented
	•	Improved resource utilisation efficiency 
	•	No production incidents attributable to capacity constraints post-implementation
	•	Documented capacity planning model aligned to forecast

✅ Financial Performance
Goal: Consolidate Image Hygiene Rules into Centralised Rule Engine
By the end of Q3 2026, design and implement a centralised rule-engine framework for image hygiene controls, consolidating existing distributed rule logic (e.g., Aqua statistics, VTM-BP, and related components) to eliminate duplication, reduce maintenance overhead, and enable configurable rule activation by workflow.

Measurable Success Criteria:
	•	All existing image hygiene rules refactored into single reusable library
	•	Elimination of duplicate rule logic across codebases
	•	Configurable on/off rule toggling per workflow
	•	Documented reduction in maintenance complexity (e.g., single change propagation model)
