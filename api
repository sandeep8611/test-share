Subject: Weekly Updates – July 4

Hi Noor,

A few updates from my side:

Oyin’s New Arrival
Oyin welcomed a baby girl yesterday! Both mother and baby are doing well.
VSaaS Support Onboarding
I had a meeting with Mo and the team – I’ve shared the meeting minutes with you (you’ve been CC’d).
Next Steps:
I’ll schedule a follow-up session to address any remaining questions and assist with onboarding to the VSaaS support entitlements.
I’ll also add the SRE team distribution list to the VSaaS Alert DL so they receive alerts from both vsaas-monitor and Netcool.
Naeem’s Care Leave
I recall you mentioned you'd be creating the HR ticket for Naeem’s care leave. Do you need anything from my end to move this forward or assist with the approval?
Manager Review
I’m working on the manager review and will share an updated feedback draft with you for review shortly.
Team Holidays – Capacity Impact
Rimas and Houssem will be out starting next Friday, which means Haroon will be the only one available on the team. I anticipate this will slow our progress through July and August.
