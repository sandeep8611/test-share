Haroon and I have a working session with the Gating team tomorrow to review the schema updates for the new endpoint that will expose container image gating results. We’ll also clarify lower-environment testing options and the CI/CD integration approach.
Since this requires coordinated delivery between the Gating team and the CI/CD team, I want to align on ownership, dependencies, and sequencing before committing to any dates. I’d prefer not to set incorrect expectations given the cross-team dependencies involved.
Let me regroup after tomorrow’s discussion. I’ll aim to provide a more concrete estimate and a high-level roadmap within about a week.
