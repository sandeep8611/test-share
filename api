Hi <Name>,
I own the VSaaS image scanning API that is currently integrated as a soft block in our Tekton CI pipelines in JPMC.
We now want to move to hard gating for container scanning, aligned with the existing GATR gating process that CI already uses for other controls. Specifically, I would like to understand how GATR is wired into Tekton today and what the recommended pattern is for onboarding an additional gate (VSaaS) so that:
Vulnerability findings from VSaaS can be evaluated as part of GATR,
Pipelines can be hard-failed based on policy, and
Overrides/waivers follow the same GATR workflow and audit trail.
Would you be available for a 30-minute session to walk through GATR’s current integration in Tekton and discuss design options for adding VSaaS as a gate?
Proposed agenda:
Quick overview of current VSaaS + Tekton soft-gating implementation
Overview of how GATR integrates with Tekton and how gates are modeled
Options to integrate VSaaS into GATR (data flow, APIs, pass/fail criteria)
Rollout approach (pilot projects, feature flags, fallbacks)
If this works for you, please suggest a time that suits your calendar, or I can send a placeholder.
