ach time Docker builds an image, it sends the entire build context — everything inside your project directory — to the Docker daemon.
A carefully maintained .dockerignore file ensures that only essential files are included in that context. This prevents unnecessary “fluff” from being sent during builds and helps maintain a clean and secure repository.
A solid .dockerignore helps you:
Reduce image bloat by excluding logs, cache files, build artifacts, and other clutter
Speed up builds by reducing the amount of data the daemon needs to process
Avoid accidental leakage of secrets, such as .env files, SSH keys, certificates, or internal configs
Keep your repository tidy, much like how .gitignore keeps version control clean
Common patterns you should consider excluding:
.git
.gitignore
node_modules/
.vscode/
*.log
.env
*.pem
*.key
dist/
build/
coverage/
*.tmp
Think of .dockerignore as the Dockerfile’s safety net:
it ensures only the necessary components make their way into your build, improving both performance and security without any extra effort at runtime.
