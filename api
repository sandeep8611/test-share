Hi Brendan,
I’m reaching out because my SNOW template recertification request has now been rejected 5–6 times, and each time a different team member reviews it and provides a different reason for rejection.
To clarify — I’m not creating a new template, only recertifying an existing one that was already approved and in use. The current version already follows the description format your team is requesting.
Could you please review the template once and share all required feedback points together, or help align the reviewers on what exactly needs to be changed (if anything)? I’d be happy to make any updates needed, but receiving different reasons for rejection each time is becoming very time-consuming.
Each submission requires updating the template, getting internal approvals, and then waiting for final review — only to have it rejected again with inconsistent comments. I’d really appreciate your help in streamlining this process so we can close it out efficiently.
Thank you for your understanding and support.
