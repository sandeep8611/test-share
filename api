Thanks for thinking ahead about the 2026 roadmap. Regarding Noor’s vision and priorities, he usually holds a meeting around this time to discuss and share his direction for the next year. That will be happening soon, and I’ll make sure to share any key updates once they’re available.
In the meantime, I’d recommend checking out Jon’s recent update on the strategy from Mark’s TownHall. His talk covers the “container-first” approach and the strategic pillars, which will give useful context for planning and help align our ideas with the broader vision.
Once we have Noor’s input, we can refine which areas—new features, new solutions, or migrations—should be prioritized.
