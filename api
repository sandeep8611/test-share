UBI 9 Micro is a specialized build that comes with no package manager, and it's easy for users to mistakenly assume it behaves like the Minimal or Standard variants. Without clear documentation, that quickly turns into confusion, incorrect usage, and a flood of support questions — which we honestly don’t have the bandwidth to handle.

Users reaching out with basic questions like “Why can’t I install packages?”
Confusion over when to use Micro vs Minimal vs Standard
Becoming the support team for things that could’ve been covered in a clear README
